          "summary": "A man (Earl Holliman) with no memory of who he is finds himself in a strange empty town.",
          "plot": "A man finds himself walking alone on a dirt road, with no memory of who he is or how he got there. He finds a diner and walks in to find a jukebox playing loudly, but nobody present; he lowers the volume and continues to call out. Eventually, he heads into the kitchen where he finds a hot pot of coffee on the stove and freshly made pies, but still no other people besides himself. He accidentally knocks over and breaks a clock, at which point the jukebox stops playing.\n\nThe man leaves the diner and walks to a nearby town; he sees a parked truck with an apparent female passenger, but \"she\" turns out to be a mannequin. Like the diner, the rest of the town seems deserted, but the man feels he is being watched and that there is someone around. The phone rings in a telephone booth and he dashes to answer it. There is nobody on the line and he can only raise a recorded message when he tries to call the operator. He grows unsettled as he wanders through the empty town, increasingly anxious to find someone to talk to.\n\nInside the police station, he uses the radio (\"Calling all cars, calling all cars, unknown man walking around police station...\"); then he notices a lit cigar in an ashtray. This prods him to check the jail cells in back. In one cell, there is evidence that someone had recently been there shaving. He declares that he wants to \"wake up now\", and makes his way to the soda shop. As he makes himself a sundae, he considers his situation to be a dream he must be having and marvels at how detailed it is. He idly spins a few racks of paperback books until he notices an entire rack of books titled The Last Man on Earth, Feb. 1959 already spinning. This spooks him and he quickly leaves.\n\nAs night falls, lights turn on and the man is drawn to the illuminated movie theater marquee. The advertised film is Battle Hymn and an advertisement outside of a man dressed as he is, directing a fighter jet on the tarmac, causes him to realize that he is in the U.S. Air Force. Running inside and finding nobody in the audience, he begins to wonder what could have happened with the Air Force that resulted in his being in this situation, until the film begins to play. He runs to the projection booth, finding it empty; in a panic, he runs downstairs and crashes into a mirror. When he recovers from this shock, he gives in to terror and races through the streets until he comes upon a \"walk\" button and desperately pushes it over and over, begging for help. The button is revealed to be a panic button: the man—Sergeant Mike Ferris—is actually in an isolation booth being observed by a group of uniformed servicemen. He has been undergoing tests to determine his fitness as an astronaut and whether he can handle a prolonged trip to the Moon alone; the town was a hallucination caused by sensory deprivation. He had been in the booth for over 484 hours.\n\nThe officiating general warns Ferris that while his basic needs will be provided for in space travel, he will not have companionship: \"next time [he will] really be alone\".  As Ferris is carried from the hangar on a stretcher, he looks into the sky and tells the Moon, \"don't go away up there\" and, \"we'll be up there in a little while\".\n\nThe barrier of loneliness: The palpable, desperate need of the human animal to be with his fellow man. Up there, up there in the vastness of space, in the void that is sky, up there is an enemy known as isolation. It sits there in the stars waiting, waiting with the patience of eons, forever waiting... in The Twilight Zone.\n\nNext week, I'll have a reunion with a unique talent and a valued friend, our first since \"Requiem for a Heavyweight\". Next week on The Twilight Zone, Mr. Ed Wynn stars in \"One for the Angels,\" playing an old pitchman who sells mechanical toys like this, but whose competition is Mr. Death. We hope you'll join us then. Thank you and good night.\n\nSterling's original pilot for The Twilight Zone was \"The Happy Place\", which revolved around a society in which people were executed upon reaching the age of 60, being considered no longer useful. CBS executive William Self rejected the story, feeling it was too dark; Serling eventually relented and wrote \"Where is Everybody?\" as a more acceptable substitute. Unlike other episodes, which were filmed at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, \"Where is Everybody?\" was filmed at Universal Studios, using Courthouse Square as the episode's Oakwood town.\n\nThe episode originally featured Westbrook Van Voorhis as narrator. When Voorhis was unavailable for later episodes, Serling re-recorded the narration himself for consistency. Serling notably changed the opening narration to place the Twilight Zone within the fifth dimension, among other alterations.\n\nSerling later adapted \"Where is Everybody?\" for a novelization titled Stories From the Twilight Zone. Serling allegedly[where?] grew dissatisfied with the lack of science fiction content and changed the story to include Ferris discovering a movie ticket in his pocket while on the stretcher.[1] A variation on this plotline was used in the episode \"King Nine Will Not Return\".[citation needed]",

Each man shoots the other in the hand, causing injuries which are minor but forever ruin both men's ability to pull a trigger.\n\nDenton tells his young opponent that they have both been blessed because they will never again be able to fire a gun in anger.

Fate tips his hat to Denton and rides quietly out of town.\n\nMr. Henry Fate, dealer in utensils and pots and pans, liniments and potions. A fanciful little man in a black frock coat who can help a man climbing out of a pit—or another man from falling into one.

Ms. Ida Lupino stars in \"The Sixteen-Millimeter Shrine,\" a haunting story of a haunted woman, that I think you'll find interesting and perhaps shocking. We hope you'll join us then. Thank you and good night.\n\nIn his 1959 promotional film shown to potential sponsors, Rod Serling summarized an earlier version of this episode's plot under its original title, \"Death, Destry, and Mr. Dingle\". As told by Serling, the basic premise is similar, but the earlier version seems to have been more comedic in tone, involving a meek schoolteacher who quite unintentionally gains notoriety as a top gunslinger. The name \"Mr. Dingle\" (originally intended for the Dan Duryea character) would be used by Serling for a future episode, with Burgess Meredith playing the eponymous character in \"Mr. Dingle, the Strong\" in 1961. The harmonica in the background is playing the Russian folksong \"Stenka Razin\" (the melody of which was later adapted for the 1965 hit \"The Carnival Is Over\" by The Seekers).\n\nAl Denton's speech to Liz Smith, in which he describes having been a top gunfighter until he turned to drink after being \"called out\" by a 16-year-old boy, was parodied in the Mel Brooks comedy Blazing Saddles. In that film, the Waco Kid (Gene Wilder) had also been a top gunfighter until he was challenged (and shot) by a six-year-old child, leading him to become an alcoholic.\n\nMartin Landau, playing here the sadistic bully to the story's protagonist, Al Denton, would return to The Twilight Zone five years later in “The Jeopardy Room”; this time he is the sadistically treated victim - a KGB major longing to defect but targeted for assassination.[1]",

She calls Danny and, when he comes over, tells him that—to her mind—Barbara has vanished from the house. He runs to the projector and sees, in the movie, the front hall of the house filled with movie stars, looking as they did in the old films. Barbara descends the stairs, welcomes them to the party and says that dinner will be by the pool. As she starts off with Jerry, Danny tries to call her back to 1959 and reality. In response, she blows a kiss, throws her scarf toward the camera, and departs. The film ends.\n\nIn the actual front hall, Danny finds Barbara's scarf. \"To wishes, Barbie\", he says wistfully. \"To the ones that come true.\"\n\nTo the wishes that come true, to the strange, mystic strength of the human animal, who can take a wishful dream and give it a dimension of its own. To Barbara Jean Trenton, movie queen of another era, who has changed the blank tomb of an empty projection screen into a private world. It can happen in the Twilight Zone.\n\nNext week, we invite you to take a strange journey back in time with Mr. Gig Young, who tries to make the exodus of all men in their desperate attempt to relive the past. We offer a most bizarre story called \"Walking Distance,\" and we hope you'll be around to share it with us. Thank you and good night.\n\nThis episode contains several similarities to Billy Wilder's 1950 film Sunset Boulevard starring Gloria Swanson and shares the same composer and conductor of music, Franz Waxman.[1] Episode director Mitchell Leisen directed Billy Wilder scripts at Paramount in the 1930s. It also evokes 1952's The Star with Bette Davis which was directed by Stuart Heisler and released by Twentieth Century Fox.\n\nIda Lupino later directed the season five episode \"The Masks\". She was both the only person to have acted in one episode and directed another, and the only woman to direct a Twilight Zone episode.\n\nMartin Balsam starred in the de facto pilot for \"Twilight Zone,\" The Time Element (broadcast as part of Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse) and returned to star in the season four episode \"The New Exhibit\". Between his two episodes of Twilight Zone, Balsam appeared in three iconic films of the era: Psycho, Breakfast at Tiffany's and Cape Fear.",

          "plot": "A man can think a lot of thoughts and walk a lot of pavements between afternoon and night. And to a man like Martin Sloan, to whom memory has suddenly become reality, a resolve can come just as clearly and inexorably as stars in the summer night. Martin Sloan is now back in time. And his resolve is to put in a claim to the past.\n\nConfused and worried, Martin wanders around town and ends up at his former home again later that evening, where he again tries to convince his parents who he is by showing his identification, but he is slapped by his mother and rejected.\n\nMartin wanders back to the park and finds his preteen self on a carousel. His advances again frighten young Martin, who falls off the merry-go-round and injures his leg. Simultaneously, adult Martin experiences excruciating pain in his leg due to the effect of the injury propagating through time to his adult self. The carousel is stopped, and Martin tries to tell his younger self to enjoy his boyhood while it lasts.\n\nAfter 11-year-old Martin is carried away, adult Martin, sitting dejectedly on the carousel, is joined by his father who tells him young Martin will be all right, but will have a limp. He also tells him that having seen money with future dates and adult Martin's driver's license (with a 1960 expiration date) from Martin's wallet, which he had dropped at the house during the confrontation earlier, he now believes Martin's story. Martin's father advises his son that everyone has his time and that instead of looking behind him, he should look ahead; as delightful and rewarding as he may remember childhood to be, adulthood holds its own delights and rewards.\n\nWhen Martin walks back into the drugstore, he finds himself back in 1959, where ice cream sodas are now 35 cents. He discovers that he now has a limp from the carousel injury. Martin makes his way back to the gas station where he picks up his car. He drives away, content for once to live his life in his own age group.\n\nMartin Sloan, age thirty-six, vice-president in charge of media. Successful in most things but not in the one effort that all men try at some time in their lives—trying to go home again. And also like all men, perhaps there'll be an occasion, maybe a summer night sometime, when he'll look up from what he's doing and listen to the distant music of a calliope, and hear the voices and the laughter of the people and the places of his past. And perhaps across his mind there'll flit a little errant wish, that a man might not have to become old, never outgrow the parks and the merry-go-rounds of his youth. And he'll smile then too, because he'll know it is just an errant wish, some wisp of memory not too important really, some laughing ghosts that cross a man's mind, that are a part of the Twilight Zone.\n\nAn excursion into fantasy on The Twilight Zone next week as two distinguished actors, Mr. David Wayne and Mr. Thomas Gomez, appear in \"Escape Clause\", the story of a strange contract between a mortal man and his most satanic majesty; a contract that ends most surprisingly. We hope you'll be around to see what that surprise is. Thank you and good night.\n\nUnlike some episodes of the show that were accompanied by pre-composed stock music cues, Walking Distance was underscored with music specially written for it. As for other Twilight Zone episodes, Bernard Herrmann—also composer of the first season's main title music and some of its stock music—wrote the music for this one. The intimate score has an isolated running time of about 19 minutes, and it is played by a 19-piece-orchestra consisting of strings (violins, violas, cellos, basses) and one harp.\n\nThe park in this episode is said to be inspired by Recreation Park in Binghamton, New York, which is located about five blocks away from Rod Serling's childhood home.[2] Like the park in \"Walking Distance\", Recreation Park has a carousel and a bandstand. The carousel is now adorned with The Twilight Zone-inspired artwork, and there is a plaque in the bandstand commemorating the episode.[2][3] In 2024 a statue of Serling was placed nearby in the park.[4] The plaque and the episode are referenced heavily in the 2014 film The Rewrite, which is mostly set in Binghamton.\n\nRod Serling, who wrote the episode, once commented, \"Every writer has his own special preoccupations and predilections. For me, it's a hunger to be young again. A desperate hunger to go back to where it all began.\"[2] Similar themes of nostalgia, its potential risks, the relentless pressures of the business world, and the disillusionments that come with being an adult are explored in \"A Stop at Willoughby\",[5] \"Young Man's Fancy\", \"The Incredible World of Horace Ford\", \"Of Late I Think of Cliffordville\", and to a lesser extent, \"The Brain Center at Whipple's\", as well as two Serling teleplays from before and after The Twilight Zone: The Kraft Television Theatre episode \"Patterns\" and the Night Gallery episode \"They're Tearing Down Tim Riley's Bar\".",

He purposely mixes a concoction of poisonous household liquids and drinks it, shocking Ethel, but it has no effect on him at all. Bedeker explains his situation to Ethel, admonishing her that if she had any imagination, she would find some way for him to experience some excitement. Proclaiming he is going to jump down the lightwell of their apartment building, Ethel futilely tries to stop him, falling to her own demise.\n\nBedeker calmly calls the police, confessing to murdering Ethel. He is arrested and brought to trial. He hopes to experience the electric chair. However, due to his lawyer's defense strategy, he is instead sentenced to life in prison without parole. Cadwallader appears in Bedeker's jail cell to remind him of the escape clause. Realizing he will face eternity in prison if he does not use it, Bedeker nods and immediately suffers a fatal heart attack.

However, when Corry hurts Alicia and sees that she is in fact capable of crying, he realizes that she has feelings. Over the next eleven months, Corry begins to fall in love with her. Alicia develops a personality that mirrors Corry's, and the days become bearable.\n\nWhen the ship returns, Captain Allenby brings news that the murder cases have been reviewed and Corry has been pardoned. He can return home to Earth immediately but they only have twenty minutes before they must leave; the crew has been dodging meteors and are nearly out of fuel. Corry learns that, because there are seven other passengers from other asteroids on the ship, there is only room for him and fifteen pounds of luggage. He is initially unconcerned as he does not have fifteen pounds' worth of possessions that he cares about; then he realizes that Allenby does not consider Alicia human. The fifteen-pound limit is far too small to accommodate her. He frantically tries to find some way to take Alicia with him, arguing that she is not a robot, but a woman, and insisting that Allenby simply does not know Alicia as he does. At that point, just as the transport crew is surprised at the sight of Alicia, the captain suddenly draws his gun and shoots her in the face. The robot breaks down, malfunctioning, her face a mass of wire and broken circuitry which repeats the name \"Corry\". Allenby then takes Corry back to the ship, assuring him he will only be leaving behind loneliness. \"I must remember that,\" Corry says tonelessly. \"I must remember to keep that in mind.\"\n\nOn a microscopic piece of sand that floats through space is a fragment of a man's life.

Investigating, he finds that the books are still intact; all the books he could ever hope for are his for the reading, and all the time he could ever hope for, to read them without interruption.\n\nHis despair gone, Bemis contentedly sorts the books he looks forward to reading for years to come, with no obligations to get in the way. Just as he bends down to pick up a book, he stumbles, and his glasses fall off and shatter. In shock, he picks up the broken remains of his glasses and breaks down in tears, surrounded by books he now can never read.\n\nThe best-laid plans of mice and men ... and Henry Bemis, the small man in the glasses who wanted nothing but time. Henry Bemis, now just a part of a smashed landscape, just a piece of the rubble, just a fragment of what man has deeded to himself. Mr. Henry Bemis, in the Twilight Zone.\n\nNext week we enlist the considerable literary talents of Charles Beaumont, and invite you to join us in a strange and shocking dream. Our story is called \"Perchance to Dream\" and stars Richard Conte. I hope you'll be able to join next week's excursion into The Twilight Zone. Thank you and good night.\n\n\"Time Enough at Last\" was one of the first episodes written for The Twilight Zone.[6] It introduced Burgess Meredith to the series; he went on to star in three more episodes, being introduced as \"no stranger to The Twilight Zone\" in promotional spots for season two's \"The Obsolete Man\". He also narrated the 1983 film Twilight Zone: The Movie, which made reference to \"Time Enough at Last\" during its opening sequence, with the characters discussing the episode in detail.",

Mueller, is deeply troubled by what the U-boat crew has done, not warning the people on board the ship before firing upon them, and wonders \"if we are not damned now\". Lanser dismissively says he is sure the British Admiralty thinks so, but Mueller clarifies that he meant damned in the eyes of God. Despite Lanser's skepticism and sarcasm, Mueller grows more convinced that their crew could one day answer for their crime by reliving the act for all eternity.\n\nGranted his own private hell as the man who ordered the massacre, Lanser reappears on the deck of the ship and the nightmare repeats itself.\n\nThe SS Queen of Glasgow, heading for New York, and the time is 1942. For one man it is always 1942—and this man will ride the ghost ship every night for eternity. This is what is meant by paying the fiddler. This is the comeuppance awaiting every man when the ledger of his life is opened and examined, the tally made, and then the reward or the penalty paid. And in the case of Carl Lanser, former Kapitan Lieutenant, Navy of the Third Reich, this is the penalty. This is the justice meted out. This is judgment night in the Twilight Zone.\n\nIn the first 18 episodes, Serling only had one minor conflict with CBS regarding episode content.  In an interview with Mike Wallace on September 22, 1959, Serling said, \"We changed, in eighteen scripts, Mike, we have had one line changed, which, again, was a little ludicrous but of insufficient basic concern within the context of the story, not to put up a fight. On a bridge of a British ship, a sailor calls down to the galley and asks in my script for a pot of tea, because I believe that it's constitutionally acceptable in the British Navy to drink tea. One of my sponsors happens to sell instant coffee (Sanka), and he took great umbrage, or at least minor umbrage anyway, with the idea of saying tea. Well, we had a couple of swings back and forth, nothing serious, and we decided we'd ask for a tray to be sent up to the bridge. But in eighteen scripts, that's the only conflict we've had.\"\n\nThe episode was adapted into a short story (by Walter B. Gibson) in the 1963 collection Rod Serling's Twilight Zone. The short story reveals how Lanser died, showing that his U-boat was sunk by a British destroyer after a crewman on the Queen of Glasgow radioed for assistance. It also adds a final scene, set 20 years after the episode, in which Barbara Stanley (revealed to have survived the sinking of the Queen of Glasgow by boarding a lifeboat) sees the ghosts of Carl Lanser and Lt. Mueller. Mueller does not share in Lanser's punishment but is doomed to witness it over and over for eternity.",

          "plot": "USAF Lieutenant Colonel Clegg Forbes arrives at a military hospital to visit his friend and co-pilot Major William Gart. The two had recently piloted an experimental spaceplane, the X-20. During their voyage the craft disappeared from radar screens for a full day before reappearing and crash landing in the desert, leaving Gart with a broken leg. Forbes is agitated and asks Gart if he remembers how many people were on the mission. Gart confirms that only he and Forbes piloted the plane, but Forbes insists that a third man – Colonel Ed Harrington, his best friend of 15 years – accompanied them.\n\nIn a flashback, Harrington and Forbes are discharged from the hospital after passing their physical exams. While visiting a bar downtown, Harrington is suddenly overcome by a feeling that he no longer \"belongs\" in the world.  Disturbed, he phones his parents, who tell him they have no son named Ed and believe the person calling them is a prankster. Harrington then mysteriously vanishes from the phone booth and no one but Forbes remembers his existence. Increasingly desperate, Forbes fruitlessly searches for any trace of his friend.\n\nBack in the present, Forbes finishes recounting the story to Gart. He is dismayed by his friend's claim that he doesn't know anyone named Harrington. Forbes then glances at a mirror and discovers he casts no reflection, causing him to flee the room in terror. Gart tries to hobble after him only to find that Forbes has disappeared. Calling the duty nurse to ask if she saw where Forbes went, Gart is stunned by the nurse's claim that nobody named Forbes was ever in the building and that Gart was the lone man in the hospital room all along, as well as the only person who went on the space mission. As she leaves, Gart is horrified and also disappears.\n\nAn officer enters the building and asks the duty nurse if there are any unused rooms available to accommodate new patients. The nurse takes him to the now completely empty room which had hosted the three astronauts, telling him that it is unoccupied. The hangar which previously housed the X-20 is then shown, with the sheet that covered the craft lying on the ground. There is no trace of the plane, as if it and its crew had never existed.\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a man named Harrington, a man named Forbes, a man named Gart. They used to exist, but don't any longer. Someone – or something – took them somewhere. At least they are no longer a part of the memory of man. And as to the X-20 supposed to be housed here in this hangar, this, too, does not exist. And if any of you have any questions concerning an aircraft and three men who flew her, speak softly of them – and only in – The Twilight Zone.\n\nThis episode is loosely based on the short story \"Disappearing Act\" by Richard Matheson.[2] The story was first published in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction (March 1953).[3]\n\nRod Taylor and director Douglas Heyes later worked together on the TV series Bearcats![4] The episode was an early acting appearance by Jim Hutton.[5]",

Assuming the glance has indicated what he needs, Renard seizes a pair of shoes from the case and puts them on, only to find that they are too tight and have slippery soles. When Pedott says that they are actually what he (Pedott) needs, Renard advances on him but slips on wet pavement and is killed by a car. Pedott then reveals he had foreseen his own death and allowed Renard to steal the shoes to prevent it. As he leaves, he gives a comb to a man, who uses it to neaten his hair before he and his wife are photographed for a news story on the accident.\n\nStreet scene, night. Traffic accident. Victim named Fred Renard, gentleman with a sour face to whom contentment came with difficulty. Fred Renard, who took all that was needed—in The Twilight Zone.\n\nThe original story featured a machine that could foretell an individual's probable future. In the story, the man owns a shop where he has such a machine and then gives people what they need to provide the best possible outcomes; also, the Renard character is killed not by a car but by falling off a subway platform while a train is coming into the station. This version of the story aired on a 1952 episode of the anthology series Tales of Tomorrow, changing the death of the Renard character from a fall to being hit by a car. For his version, Serling replaced the science-fiction element with a street peddler who could magically perform the same function.\n\nThe final shot before the first commercial (while Serling is concluding his narration) is actually played backwards; looking carefully, one can see smoke returning to Renard's cigarette.\n\nDuring the scene in Mr. Renard's hotel room, a bellhop brings him a newspaper. Renard then opens it and spreads it out on the floor. The movement is quick, but the front page of the newspaper is visible, indicating that it is the same front page used in another Twilight Zone episode, \"Time Enough at Last\". The headline reads \"H-Bomb Capable of Total Destruction\". Once Renard opens the paper and looks at the racing page, several in-jokes or Easter eggs are apparent in the names of the listed jockeys, which include \"Serling\", \"Clemens\" (referencing director of photography George Clemens), \"Houghton\" (referencing producer Buck Houghton), \"Butler\" (referencing set decorator Rudy Butler), and \"Denault\" (referencing assistant director Edward Denault).",

A detective comes by to pick him up for questioning; together, they leave for the police station. As they enter the hotel's revolving door, Hammer again assumes the boxer's appearance. The detective rushes back into the building to find Hammer.\n\nMarshak's father is standing on the street, with a gun on Hammer. The con man tries to demonstrate that he is not who the old man thinks he is, but before he can concentrate and change his face, Mr. Marshak shoots him. As Hammer lies dying, his face shifts from one person to another until he dies wearing his own face.\n\nHe was Arch Hammer, a cheap little man who just checked in.

Carling, suspicious of Sturka since their chat, eavesdrops on them at Sturka's house and overhears their plan. Later that night, everyone gathers for a game of cards where Riden reveals that while he was test flying the spacecraft, the military had discovered a small planet 11 million miles away with a civilization similar to theirs—the perfect place to escape. During the game, Carling unexpectedly appears at the door and hints that he knows what the group is plotting. He also hints at trouble: \"A lot can happen in forty-eight hours.\" After Carling leaves, Sturka receives a call from his superiors, commanding him to return to the base. He and Riden inform the women that they must leave that very moment.\n\nWhen the five arrive at the site of the spacecraft, Sturka and Riden spot their contact, who flashes a light. When the contact steps forward, he is revealed to be Carling, armed with a gun. He forces Sturka and Riden away from the gate and prepares to call the authorities. The women, who have been waiting in the car, watch as Carling orders them out. Jody suddenly throws the car's door open, knocking the gun from Carling's hand and giving the men enough time to overpower him and knock him out. The group rushes into the ship, fighting off the pursuing guards.\n\nMuch later, the group has safely escaped their doomed planet and are on course. Sturka says it's hard to believe there are people living on the alien world where they're headed.

He befriends a wounded alien and helps him return to his home planet; the boy grows up to be an astronaut and reunites with the alien.

The mechanic she has called to come put a spare tire on comments that he is surprised she survived, saying \"you shouldn't have called for a mechanic. Somebody should've called for a hearse.\" He directs her to follow him into town where he will supply her with a new tire. As she is driving from the site of her blow-out, Nan notices a shabby and strange-looking man hitchhiking. Later, as she is preparing to leave the service station in town, she again sees this hitchhiker, but the mechanic does not see him when she mentions it. Unnerved, she drives away. As she continues her trip, Nan sees the same hitchhiker thumbing for a ride again in Virginia and at several other points in her journey.\n\nShe grows increasingly frightened of him. When she stops at a railroad crossing for an oncoming train, the man is situated on the other side of the tracks. She decides to drive ahead but the car stalls on the tracks. She manages to restart the vehicle and back up just as the train speeds past.\n\nNan is now convinced that the hitchhiker is trying to kill her. She continues to drive, becoming more and more afraid, stopping only when necessary. Every time she stops, however, the hitchhiker is there, always ahead of her.\n\nShe takes a side road in New Mexico but becomes stranded when she runs out of gas. She reaches a gas station on foot but it is closed; although she rouses the proprietor from bed, he refuses to reopen and sell her gas due to the late hour. Nan is startled by a sailor on his way back to San Diego from leave. Eager for protection from the hitchhiker, she offers to drive the sailor all the way to his destination. He gladly accepts and persuades the station attendant to provide gas. As they drive together and discuss their mutual predicaments, she sees the hitchhiker on the road and swerves toward him. The sailor, who cannot see him, questions her driving; she admits she was trying to run over the hitchhiker. The sailor begins to fear for his safety and leaves her despite her efforts to have him stay, even going so far as offering to go out with him.\n\nIn Arizona, Nan stops to call her mother in Manhattan, New York City. The woman who answers the phone says Mrs. Adams is in the hospital, having suffered a nervous breakdown after finding out that her daughter, Nan, died in Pennsylvania six days ago when the car she was driving blew a tire and overturned. Nan realizes the truth: she didn't survive the accident in Pennsylvania and the hitchhiker is none other than the personification of death, patiently and persistently waiting for her to realize that she has been dead all along. She loses all emotion, concern, and feels empty.\n\nNan returns to the car and looks in the vanity mirror on the visor. Instead of her reflection, she sees the hitchhiker, who says, \"I believe you're going...my way?\"\n\nNan Adams, age twenty-seven. She was driving to California; to Los Angeles. She didn't make it.

He again hears the machine calling his name, then sees it coming down the hallway toward the couple's room and pursuing him. To his horror, its coin hopper is now covered by a hood etched with a large smile. Flora can neither see nor hear the machine as it backs Franklin up toward the window, until he crashes backwards through it and falls to his death. The police stand over his body, noting that his wife had stated that he had not slept in 24 hours, and a casino manager comments that he has never seen anyone develop a gambling addiction so quickly and severely. Franklin's last dollar rolls across the pavement to stop by his outstretched hand, and the camera pans in the direction from which it came and there sits the slot machine, \"smiling\".\n\nMr. Franklin Gibbs, visitor to Las Vegas, who lost his money, his reason, and finally his life to an inanimate, metal machine, variously described as a \"one-armed bandit\", a \"slot machine\", or, in Mr. Franklin Gibbs' words, a \"monster with a will all of its own.\" For our purposes, we'll stick with the latter definition because we're in the Twilight Zone.\n\nIn Serling: The Rise and Twilight of Television's Last Angry Man, Gordon F.

          "plot": "Decker learns that his flying partner, Alexander Mackaye, is an air vice-marshal and a hero in World War II who saved hundreds, if not thousands, of lives by shooting down three German bombers over London one night during the Blitz. By chance, Mackaye is coming to the base that very day for an inspection. Decker says that is impossible, as Mackaye is dead. Harper, at this time, confiscates Decker's pistol and personal effects. Later, Major Wilson questions the young man. Decker refers to Mackaye by a private nickname, \"Old Leadbottom\", explaining that at one point, he was shot in an embarrassing spot by German infantry. Decker finally confesses that he is a coward who avoided combat throughout his service, and that he deliberately abandoned Mackaye when the two were attacked by a flight of German fighters. He refuses to believe that Mackaye somehow survived against such odds.\n\nWhen Wilson suggests that someone helped him, Decker realizes that he has been given a second chance. He tells the American officer that there was no one within 50 miles who could have come to Mackaye's aid, so if Mackaye survived, it had to be because Decker went back himself. Decker pleads with Wilson to release him. When Wilson refuses, Decker assaults him and a guard and escapes. Outside, he locates his plane, punches a mechanic who tries to get in his way, and starts the plane's engine. He is about to take off when Wilson catches up and puts a pistol to his head. Decker tells Wilson he will have to shoot him to stop him. After hesitating, Wilson lets him go.  Decker flies into the strange cloud and vanishes.\n\nHarper rebukes Wilson for believing such a fantastic story and for allowing \"that maniac\" to escape. When Mackaye arrives, Wilson asks him if he knows a William Terrance Decker; he replies, \"Oh I certainly should know him—he saved my life.\" Mackaye proceeds to recount how Decker and he were jumped by seven German aircraft while out on patrol. Mackaye thought at first that Decker had fled, but suddenly Decker came diving down, seemingly out of nowhere, with his guns blazing, and proceeded to shoot down three enemy planes before being shot down himself. General Harper then shows him Decker's confiscated identification card (with a photo) and other personal effects. This leaves Mackaye stunned. When he demands an explanation, Wilson says, \"Maybe you'd better sit down, Old Leadbottom.\"\n\nDialog from a play, Hamlet to Horatio: There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy. Dialog from a play written long before men took to the sky: There are more things in heaven and earth and in the sky than perhaps can be dreamt of. And somewhere in between heaven, the sky, and the earth, lies the Twilight Zone.\n\nThis was the first episode of The Twilight Zone scripted by Richard Matheson.  Rod Serling had previously adapted the episodes \"And When the Sky Was Opened\" and \"Third from the Sun\" from short stories of Matheson's.\n\nRadio historian Martin Grams Jr. noted the similarities between this episode and a 1948 episode of the acclaimed radio drama series Quiet, Please called \"One for the Book\". According to Grams' book The Twilight Zone: Unlocking the Door to a Television Classic, Serling himself was so concerned about the similarities that he attempted to buy the rights to the Quiet, Please episode to avoid any potential copyright infringement.\n\nThe American \"airbase in France\" where this episode was filmed was actually Norton Air Force Base, a former USAF base in San Bernardino, California now known as San Bernardino International Airport.

          "plot": "Converging on the center of town, they are startled to find someone who does move: \"Jeremy Wickwire\", the caretaker of this place. He is told by the men that a nuclear war destroyed much of the Earth in 1985, and that it has taken two hundred years to recover from it. Wickwire explains to the astronauts that the asteroid they have landed on is an exclusive cemetery called \"Happy Glades\", founded in 1973, where rich people can live out their life's greatest fantasy after they die. The town is one of many areas where people may be placed; others include the Roman era, the Egyptian era, and the Wild West. This town is the most popular because it represents a time in American culture where creature comforts were most abundant.\n\nWickwire serves the three men wine and asks each man what his greatest wish is. All three reply that they wish they were on their ship heading for home. Wickwire misunderstood who the astronauts were, thinking they were from the Happy Glades organization. He explains the reason Happy Glades exists is because it's not possible to have peace on Earth. Wickwire (who explains that he is a robot that has been deactivated for \"about 200 years\" and only turns on for occasional duties) apologizes to them, and explains that it is his job to ensure peace and tranquility at \"Happy Glades\". Suddenly, they realize that their drinks have been poisoned with what Wickwire refers to as \"eternifying fluid\". As the men are dying, the astronaut pleads for an antidote, and that they mean no harm. Wickwire responds that they \"are men, and while there are men, there can be no peace.\"\n\nLater, Wickwire re-installs the embalmed astronauts in their ship, posing them at their posts as if they were on their way home.\n\nKirby, Webber, and Meyers, three men lost. They shared a common wish—a simple one, really. They wanted to be aboard their ship headed for home. And fate—a laughing fate—a practical jokester with a smile that stretched across the stars, saw to it that they got their wish with just one reservation: the wish came true, but only in the Twilight Zone.\n\nInside the spaceship, \"equipment\" originally constructed for the film Forbidden Planet was reused for this episode, and shows up in a number of other Twilight Zone episodes. The sound effects heard inside the spaceship would be used again six years later as some of the sounds on the bridge of the starship USS Enterprise, in the original Star Trek television series. The song played in the scene with the frozen marching band is \"Hot Time\" by the University of Wisconsin’s marching band. The set of the room of the frozen mayor addressing the crowd had been used in the previous episodes \"The Sixteen-Millimeter Shrine\" as part of Barbara Trenton's home, as well as in \"The Purple Testament\" as the lobby of an Army hospital. It would be used again as a hallway of a college campus in \"Long Live Walter Jameson\".

          "summary": "A power failure causes the residents of a suburban neighborhood to suspect one another of being monsters from outer space planning an invasion.",
          "plot": "One late-summer afternoon, Maple Street is full of children playing and adults talking and doing yard work, when a shadow passes over, accompanied by a roar and a flash of light. Everyone notices, but they assume it is a passing meteor and resume their activities. The residents soon discover that their power went off, affecting stoves, lawnmowers, cars, phones, even portable radios, and they gather in the street to discuss the situation. Pete Van Horn volunteers to walk over to Floral Street, to see if it is affected. His neighbors, Steve Brand and Charlie Farnsworth, decide to go into town to investigate further, but Tommy, a neighborhood boy, urges them not to go. Tommy has read a story of an alien invasion causing similar issues, and says that the monsters do not want anyone to leave the street. Tommy adds that in the story, the aliens are living as a family that appears to be human but are actually scouts, and the power outage they cause is to isolate the neighborhood. The adults are incredulous, assuring him that the cause is natural.\n\nAnother resident, Les Goodman, tries unsuccessfully to start his car. However, after he walks away from the car, it starts by itself. This makes the neighbors suspect that Les may be an alien. As they all gather, one woman brings up Les' late nights spent standing in the garden looking at the sky, as if waiting or looking for something. Les, defending himself as a resident of Maple Street for five years, claims to suffer from insomnia and admonishes his neighbors that they should use caution and not panic. Steve tries to defuse the situation and prevent it from becoming a witch-hunt, but tensions remain high.\n\nAs darkness descends, Charlie begins keeping watch over Les Goodman's house. Steve suggests Charlie go home to bed. Another neighbor, Don, mentions that Steve has built his own radio set, which Charlie then claims no one has ever seen. As suspicion mounts, Steve's wife protests that it is a simple ham radio, but Steve sarcastically answers that he talks to aliens with it. Steve and the other neighbors continue to argue, using each person's idiosyncrasies as evidence that they are an alien. Steve warns that such behavior, looking for a scapegoat, is the surest way for the entire neighborhood to \"eat each other up alive\".\n\nA shadowy figure approaches the residents, which Tommy exclaims is the monster. Claiming it may be necessary for protection, Don obtains a double-barrelled shotgun that Steve immediately confiscates. As the figure gets closer, Charlie panics, taking the shotgun and shooting the figure. Upon reaching the fallen figure, they realize it is Pete Van Horn (who had gone to see if Floral Street had power earlier), and he is now dead. As Charlie struggles to defend his hasty action, the lights in his house come on by themselves, causing the residents to turn on him. Don suspiciously asks Charlie why his power is restored, while Les rebukes him for being so quick to kill and accuse, suggesting that perhaps Pete had found proof of Charlie's extraterrestrial origins, and that the latter shot the former to silence him. Even Steve does not advocate for Charlie, outraged by his senseless murder of Pete. Charlie makes a break for his house; everyone chases him, throwing stones, one of which smashes a porch lantern, causing the broken glass to fly at Charlie's face, cutting his forehead. Terrified, Charlie attempts to deflect suspicion onto Tommy. While his mother is quick to defend him, several neighbors agree with this idea, as Tommy was the only one who knew about the aliens' plans. Steve continues to try to defuse the situation, but no one listens.\n\nLights begin flashing on and off in houses throughout the neighborhood; lawnmowers and car engines start and stop for no reason. The mob becomes hysterical, hurling accusations, smashing windows, and taking up weapons as the situation devolves into an all-out riot.\n\nMeanwhile, at a nearby hilltop, two humanoid aliens are observing the riot on Maple Street while using a device to manipulate the neighborhood's power. They comment on how simply fiddling with routine leads people to descend into paranoia and panic that can be exploited. They also discuss their intention to use this strategy to conquer Earth, one neighborhood at a time. They then ascend a stairway into their spaceship, which then takes off.\n\nThe tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout. There are weapons that are simply thoughts, attitudes, prejudices ... to be found only in the minds of men. For the record, prejudices can kill, and suspicion can destroy, and a thoughtless, frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all of its own ... for the children and the children yet unborn. And the pity of it is, that these things cannot be confined only to The Twilight Zone.\n\nThe aliens are wearing uniforms previously worn by characters in the 1956 science fiction film Forbidden Planet. Also, the mockup set of the retractable stairway, leading into the lower half of the C-57D cruiser from the same film, is reused for this scene.[2] At the end of the episode, footage of the alien spaceship was used from Forbidden Planet (1956), only backwards and upside-down.  A different shot from the movie was also used in \"Third from the Sun\".  This technique was also used in \"To Serve Man\".[3] The cruiser is shown upside down when compared to its orientation in Forbidden Planet.\n\nA 2003 remake of the episode was produced for the 2002 revival of The Twilight Zone, but it was renamed \"The Monsters Are on Maple Street\". Serling received \"Story By\" credit. It starred Andrew McCarthy as Will Marshall and Titus Welliver as Dylan. The difference between the two is that the remake is more about the fear of terrorism. When the power surge happens in the remake, it is caused not by aliens, but instead by the government, specifically the United States Army, experimenting on how small towns react to the fear of terrorism. In the end, the neighborhood takes out its anger and frustration on a family who never left their house after the power surge occurred, thinking that they caused it since they still have power. The residents all fail the test miserably as did all the other inhabitants of every other street they tested.",

          "plot": "Walter Jameson, a college professor, is engaged to a young doctoral student named Susanna Kittridge. Susanna's father, Sam Kittridge, another professor at Jameson's college, becomes suspicious of Jameson because he does not appear to have aged in the twelve years they have known each other and seems to have unrealistically detailed knowledge of some pieces of history that do not appear in texts. Jameson at one point reads from an original Civil War diary in his possession. Later, Kittridge spots the diary's author, Major Hugh Skelton, in a Mathew Brady Civil War photograph and finds Jameson looks exactly like Skelton.\n\nAfter Kittridge presents these pieces of evidence, Jameson ultimately reveals his real life history. Agelessness (but no immunity to injury) was imparted to him by an alchemist more than 2,000 years ago. Jameson does not know what was done to him, only that the alchemist was gone when he recovered, and he then stopped aging. Soon, he had to become a constant refugee. He tells Kittridge he has learned from living for so long that the point of death is to make life meaningful. He keeps a revolver in his desk drawer, but does not have the courage to use it.\n\nRealizing that if Jameson marries his daughter, she will grow old, and Jameson will eventually abandon her in order to keep his secret, Kittridge refuses permission for Jameson to marry his daughter. Jameson defies him by proposing to Susanna that they immediately elope. Kittridge vows to expose Jameson, but he reminds Kittridge that no one will believe him.\n\nBriefly stopping at his study, Jameson is accosted by a woman named Laurette, who identifies him as Tom Bowen, her husband. Laurette claims she cannot allow Jameson to abandon Susanna as he abandoned her years ago. She discovers Jameson's pistol lying on his desk and shoots him. Shortly after Bowen leaves, Kittridge enters Jameson's study and finds him bleeding, but seemingly at peace. Jameson rapidly ages and collapses on the floor. Susanna enters the house. Kittridge tries to stop her from seeing the aged Jameson, saying only that he is gone. He is unable to keep her out of the room, but inside she discovers only an empty suit of clothes with a white substance near the collar and sleeves. When Susanna asks what is on the floor, the professor replies, \"Dust, only dust.\"\n\nLast stop on a long journey, as yet another human being returns to the vast nothingness that is the beginning and into the dust that is always the end.\n\nThe scenes of Walter Jameson's aging were performed by using an old movie-making trick. Age lines were drawn on actor Kevin McCarthy's face in red make-up. During the beginning of the scene, red lighting was used, bathing the scene in red and hiding the age lines. As the scene progressed, the red lights were turned down and green lights were brought up. Under the green lights, the red age lines were prominent. The lighting changes were unseen by the audience because it was filmed in black-and-white. A subsequent episode, \"Queen of the Nile\", used a similar effect.\n\nFor the DVD release Kevin McCarthy returned to record an audio commentary for the episode, revealing that he never met Rod Serling and that, aside from Invasion of the Body Snatchers, his appearance in this episode generated the most fan mail he ever received.",

          "plot": "They lead Conrad to his residence — an interior living space furnished precisely in the same manner as one on Earth (specifically, a living space in middle-class America) would have been. The locals leave and Conrad asks if he will see Teenya again. She doesn't respond, but another local assures Conrad he will see her again. Conrad relaxes, but soon discovers that his room is windowless and the doors cannot be opened. One of the walls slides apart, and Conrad realizes that he has become a caged exhibit in a Martian alien zoo. Conrad picks up a sign saying EARTH CREATURE IN HIS NATIVE HABITAT, and throws it on the floor as Teenya leaves distraught. In the episode's closing lines, Conrad grips the bars and proclaims, \"Marcusson! Marcusson, you were right! You were right. People are alike... people are alike everywhere.\"\n\nSpecies  of animal brought back alive. Interesting similarity in physical characteristics to human beings in head, trunk, arms, legs, hands, feet. Very tiny undeveloped brain. Comes from primitive planet named Earth. Calls himself Samuel Conrad. And he will remain here in his cage with the running water and the electricity and the central heat as long as he lives. Samuel Conrad has found The Twilight Zone.\n\nThis episode was based on Paul W. Fairman's \"Brothers Beyond the Void\", published in the March 1952 issue of Fantastic Adventures  and also included in August Derleth's 1953 anthology collection Worlds of Tomorrow. In this renowned short story, Sam Conrad remains on Earth and it is the lone pilot Marcusson who has the too-close encounter with smaller, more alien Martians. In adapting the tale, Serling made key changes that would deepen the irony and heighten the impact. He installed the apprehensive, defeatist Conrad as the protagonist, easing his fears, only to have them ultimately confirmed; and he presented the Martians as a human-like superior race whose apparent benevolence would make their climactic treachery seem even more shocking, as well as decrease the budget that would have been expended on costumes and makeup.\n\nThe Martian exteriors are taken from the oversize painted background dioramas seen in the 1956 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film Forbidden Planet. Additionally, a set of four lights on the wall of the inside of the space ship are reuses of the Krell power gauges from the same film.\n\nMarcusson is portrayed by Paul Comi, a frequent guest star in TV shows of the 1960s and 1970s, including Star Trek.  His other TZ work was in the second season's \"The Odyssey of Flight 33\", where he played the co-pilot, and the fourth season's \"The Parallel\".\n\nActor Byron Morrow twice appeared as an admiral on Star Trek.  Actor Vic Perrin was later the \"Control Voice\" of The Outer Limits, and—like Oliver, Morrow and Comi—would also become another veteran of Star Trek.\n\nCat Yampell, comparing the show to other science fiction stories such as Planet of the Apes (also starring Roddy McDowall) and Slaughterhouse-Five, wrote: \"Alien caging of humans provides commentary on the barbarity of the practice of turning sentient beings into public spectacles.\"[1]\n\nThe original pilot of Star Trek (\"The Cage\", later reworked into the two-part episode \"The Menagerie\") included plot points similar to that touched upon in this episode, particularly the aspect of humans being put on display for study. Coincidentally, that pilot also co-starred Susan Oliver in a similar role (Vina, a female has the task of making the captive feel more at ease). The Star Trek animated episode \"Eye of the Beholder\" would also feature some of the crew of the USS Enterprise being placed in a zoo by the inhabitants of Lactra VII.\n\nThe band Space Monkey Death Sequence released their similarly titled debut album, \"People Are Alike All Over\", containing many samples from the episodes, citing the installment as the influence for the album.[2]\n\nThe second episode of the television series The Orville, which is titled Command Performance, revolves around the two main characters, Captain Ed Mercer and Commander Kelly Grayson, being placed in a zoo along with other captured alien species.",

Henry remembers making the biggest wish he possibly could for Bolie, but since it did not work, he declares with resignation that he will not be making any more wishes. \"There ain't no such thing as magic, is there?\" he asks Bolie. \"I guess not, Henry,\" Bolie replies sadly. \"Or maybe...maybe there is magic.

Mr. Bolie Jackson, who shares the most common ailment of all men, the strange and perverse disinclination to believe in a miracle, the kind of miracle to come from the mind of a little boy, perhaps only to be found in the Twilight Zone.\n\nThe all-black principal cast was groundbreaking for television in 1960. Said Rod Serling at the time (quoted in The Twilight Zone Companion by Marc Scott Zicree):\n\nTelevision, like its big sister, the motion picture, has been guilty of the sin of omission... Hungry for talent, desperate for the so-called 'new face,' constantly searching for a transfusion of new blood, it has overlooked a source of wondrous talent that resides under its nose. This is the Negro actor.\n\nA few other Twilight Zones followed the example of this episode and cast black actors in significant roles, including the pastor in \"I Am the Night—Color Me Black\" (also played by Ivan Dixon), a child in the mall in \"The Night of the Meek\", and the electrician in \"The Brain Center at Whipple's\". These inclusions, though seemingly insignificant by modern standards, were so revolutionary at the time that The Twilight Zone was awarded the Unity Award for Outstanding Contributions to Better Race Relations in 1961.\n\nOriginally cast in the lead role was champion boxer Archie Moore, who later exclaimed, \"Man, I was in the Twilight Zone!\" when describing the punch delivered by his opponent Yvon Durelle.\n\nThis is one of several episodes from season one where some broadcast prints have the opening title sequence replaced with that of season two. This was done during the summer of 1961 to help the season one shows fit in with the new look the show had taken during the following season.\n\nThe hallway shown in this episode is also used in \"Mr. Bevis\", episode 33, but slightly altered. However, the door and stair railings remain the same.\n\nThe boxing match takes place at \"St. Nick's Arena\", which was the name of a boxing arena in New York City, the St. Nicholas Rink.[1][2]",

For Rocky Valentine, it's just the beginning.\n\nAfter robbing a pawn shop, Henry Francis \"Rocky\" Valentine is shot in a gunfight by a police officer as he tries to flee. He wakes up to find himself seemingly unharmed by the encounter as a genial, elderly white-suited man named Pip greets him. Pip explains that he has been instructed to guide Rocky and give him whatever he desires. Rocky becomes suspicious, supposing that Pip is attempting to defraud him, but Pip proves to have detailed information about Rocky's tastes and hobbies. Rocky demands that Pip hand over his wallet; Pip says that he does not carry one, but gives Rocky $700 directly from his pocket and says that he can provide as much money as Rocky wants.\n\nThinking that Pip is trying to entice him to commit a crime, Rocky holds him at gunpoint as the two travel to a luxurious apartment. Pip explains that the apartment and everything in it are free, and Rocky starts to relax and changes into an expensive suit. His suspicions arise again, however, when a meal is brought in, and he demands that Pip taste it first to prove that it is not poisoned. When Pip demurs, claiming he has forgotten how to eat after not doing so for centuries, Rocky shoots him several times, but finds that his bullets have no effect. Rocky realizes that he is dead, and he concludes that he is in Heaven and Pip is his guardian angel. Pip looks at him oddly but only says that Rocky can have anything he wants. Rocky asks for $1 million and a beautiful woman, and quickly has both requests fulfilled.\n\nRocky visits a casino with three women, winning every bet he makes as beautiful girls gather around him, and enjoys being able to torment a policeman after Pip shrinks him. Later, Rocky asks Pip if he can see some of his old friends who have also died, but Pip says that this world is for Rocky alone. Except for the two men, no one in it is real. When Rocky wonders what good deeds he could have done to gain entrance to Heaven, Pip takes him to visit the Hall of Records. Rocky looks through his own file and discovers that it only contains a list of his crimes, but decides not to worry about it. Pip departs, saying that he can be reached by telephone as needed.\n\nOne month later, Rocky has become bored with having his whims instantly satisfied. He wins every game at the casino, and the women do anything he wants. He calls Pip, who instantly appears, and asks for a challenge in which he might run the risk of losing. Pip offers to arrange for him to lose once in a while at the casino, but Rocky dismisses the idea as he would know about the setup. Pip suggests robbing a bank, but Rocky quickly abandons that idea as well, since a pre-planned outcome would take the thrill out of the crime. Rocky muses to Pip over his lack of satisfaction at being given everything he wants with no effort or risk. Deciding that he will go insane if he stays in this stifling paradise any longer, Rocky asks Pip to send him to \"the other place\" — insisting that he does not belong in Heaven. Pip retorts, \"Heaven? Whatever gave you the idea you were in Heaven, Mr. Valentine? This IS the other place!\"\n\nPip then laughs malevolently as he watches a now-horrified Rocky unsuccessfully try to escape his \"paradise\".\n\nA scared, angry little man who never got a break. Now he has everything he's ever wanted – And he's going to have to live with it for eternity – In The Twilight Zone.\n\nThe unreleased They Might Be Giants song \"Hell Hotel\" is based on \"A Nice Place to Visit\". According to producer Bill Krauss, the song references the episode's plot and lead actor Sebastian Cabot.[6]\n\nDonald Trump has said that this episode of The Twilight Zone inspired his philosophy of success, commenting, \"I fight hard for victory, and I think I enjoy it as much as I ever did. But I realize that maybe new victories won't be the same as the first couple.\"[7][8][9]\n\nThe \"I Dated a Robot\" episode of Futurama begins with the main characters watching an episode of The Scary Door (a parody of the Twilight Zone). It begins with a man named Clyde Smith in a casino where he always wins.

As he is about to get off the train carrying his briefcase, the train begins to roll, returning him to the present. Williams promises himself to get off at Willoughby next time.\n\nExperiencing a breakdown at work, he calls his wife, who abandons him in his time of need. On his way home, he once again falls asleep to find himself in Willoughby. This time, as the conductor warmly beckons him to the door, Williams intentionally leaves his briefcase on the train. Getting off the train, he is greeted by name by various inhabitants who welcome him while he tells them he's glad to be there and plans to stay and join their idyllic life.\n\nThe swinging pendulum of the station clock fades into the swinging lantern of a railroad engineer, standing over Williams' body. The 1960 conductor explains to the engineer that Williams \"shouted something about Willoughby\", before jumping off the train and being killed instantly. Williams' body is loaded into a hearse. The back door of the hearse closes to reveal the name of the funeral home: Willoughby & Son.\n\nWilloughby? Maybe it's wishful thinking nestled in a hidden part of a man's mind, or maybe it's the last stop in the vast design of things—or perhaps, for a man like Mr. Gart Williams, who climbed on a world that went by too fast, it's a place around the bend where he could jump off. Willoughby? Whatever it is, it comes with sunlight and serenity, and is a part of The Twilight Zone.\n\nThe name \"Willoughby\" presumably comes from the Midwestern town of Willoughby, Ohio, near Cleveland. There are, however, other places with that name in other parts of the United States, including a Willoughby Creek near Great Valley, New York (however, it is located in the southwest part of the state, nowhere near Connecticut or New York City). Another possible inspiration is Willoughby Avenue, a street only a few miles from the Sony Pictures Studios (formerly MGM) where nearly all Twilight Zone episodes were shot.[1]\n\nThe \"Stamford\" and \"Westport/Saugatuck\" stops called out by the conductor in the episode do exist—Metro-North Railroad (at the time New Haven Railroad) stops in Fairfield County, Connecticut, include Stamford (the station is now the Stamford Transportation Center), and Westport (the station was once known as Westport & Saugatuck), where series creator Rod Serling once lived.[2]\n\nWilliams' home phone number, CApital 7-9899, includes what was once a legitimate central office name for Westport.\n\n\"Beautiful Dreamer\", a song first published in 1864 and still popular in the 1880s and beyond, can be heard being played by a band. \"Oh! Susanna\", published in 1848 and among the most popular American songs ever written, is also heard.\n\nWilloughby, Ohio, calls its annual neighborhood festival \"Last Stop: Willoughby\" in honor of the episode.[4][5][6]",

I had total freedom. Sometimes I would think of an idea that would make the episode more Twilight Zone-y [but] that would require some expense. I remember one episode, 'The Chaser', in which I devised a huge bookcase that must have doubled the budget, but [Serling and producer Buck Houghton] never blinked an eye. They just said, 'Okay, great!' I didn't have to argue with anybody over the money—they'd argue about the money and let me have it! I knew that they were having problems with Jim Aubrey, but they kept them away from me. My responsibility was to get the job done.\"\n\nThe short story also was adapted in 1951 for the Tales from the Crypt comic, where it was retitled \"Loved to Death!!\" This was adapted in 1991 as \"Loved to Death\" (no exclamation points) for the HBO adult-horror anthology series Tales from the Crypt. The episode starred Andrew McCarthy and Mariel Hemingway.\n\nThis is one of several episodes from season one with its opening title sequence plastered over with the opening for season two.

Bevis then meets and gets assistance from his guardian angel, one J. Hardy Hempstead. Bevis gets to start the day over again, but there is a catch: in order to continue in his new life, Bevis must make some changes, including no strange clothes, no loud zither music, in effect no longer the well-liked neighborhood goofball.\n\nHe accepts, and the first thing he notices is that his personal transportation is now an Austin-Healey sportscar instead of his previous jalopy, a soot-spewing 1924 Rickenbacker. He later discovers that he is a success at work, and his rent is paid. As the day goes on, he realizes that all of his eccentricities, and the affection from his fellow citizens, were the things that made him happy. Bevis asks that things be returned to the way they were. Hempstead obliges, initially warning Bevis that he will still have no job, car, or apartment. However, perhaps moved by the warmth people have for Bevis, and the man's genuine kindness, the angel arranges for him to get his old jalopy back.\n\nLater, Mr. Bevis is shown finishing his fifth shot of whiskey, and he pays his total tab of $5.00 with one bill. He then leaves the bar, and finds his Rickenbacker is parked in front of a fire hydrant. When Bevis is about to be ticketed for this infraction, the hydrant suddenly disappears and reappears next to the officer's motorcycle. \"J. Hardy Hempstead\" is still watching over Bevis.\n\nMr. James B. W. Bevis, who believes in a magic all his own. The magic of a child's smile, the magic of liking and being liked, the strange and wondrous mysticism that is the simple act of living. Mr. James B. W.

          "plot": "Miss Marsha White on the ninth floor, specialties department, looking for a gold thimble. The odds are that she'll find it—but there are even better odds that she'll find something else, because this isn't just a department store. This happens to be The Twilight Zone.\n\nMarsha White, browsing for a gift for her mother in a department store, decides on a gold thimble. A crowd of people are waiting for the elevator. She notices another elevator is empty.  The male elevator operator advises her that thimbles are on the ninth floor.  As the elevator rises, the floor indicator shows only eight floors. When Marsha walks out onto the dark, empty ninth floor, a saleswoman leads her to the only item on the floor: a gold thimble. Marsha is puzzled and unsettled by the behavior of the elevator operator and the saleswoman, who knows her name. The saleswoman asks Marsha if she is happy; Marsha responds that it is none of her business and storms off. As Marsha rides the elevator down, she notices the thimble is scratched and dented; the elevator operator directs her to the complaints department on the third floor.\n\nShe tells the sales supervisor and the store manager that she bought the item on the ninth floor.  They do not believe her, telling her there is no ninth floor. She has no evidence of the transaction as she paid cash, and has no receipt. Marsha then thinks she sees the saleswoman, and is shocked to discover that the figure is actually a display mannequin. While resting in an office to recover from the shock, Marsha is accidentally locked inside the store after hours. Searching for a way out, she becomes alarmed by voices calling to her and by subtle movements made by the mannequins around her. Wandering the floor, she topples the sailor mannequin, whom she recognizes as the elevator operator.\n\nShe begins sobbing and flees backward to the now-open elevator, which again takes her to the ninth floor. There she gradually realizes that the \"ninth floor\" is a storage area occupied by thinking, animated mannequins. With the mannequins' gentle encouragement, she eventually accepts that she herself is also a mannequin. The mannequins take turns, one at a time, to live among humans for one month.  Marsha had enjoyed her stay among \"the outsiders\" so much, she had forgotten her identity and has arrived back a day late. The next mannequin in line — the saleswoman — forgives Marsha for her tardiness and then departs the store to take her turn. As the other mannequins bid farewell to the saleswoman, the sailor asks Marsha if she enjoyed her time among humans; she sweetly and sadly says she did.\n\nThe next day, the sales supervisor makes his morning rounds on the sales floor and does a double-take upon passing the Marsha mannequin on display.\n\nMarsha White, in her normal and natural state, a wooden lady with a painted face who, one month out of the year, takes on the characteristics of someone as normal and as flesh and blood as you and I. But it makes you wonder, doesn't it, just how normal are we? Just who are the people we nod our hellos to as we pass on the street? A rather good question to ask . . . particularly, in the Twilight Zone.\n\nThe head of the mannequin double for Anne Francis was made from a cast of Francis's face done by noted make-up artist William J. Tuttle. Tuttle displayed the mannequin head in the 1968 MGM short film \"The King of the Duplicators\".[1]\n\nThe episode was remade in 1986 for the first revival of The Twilight Zone. It starred Terry Farrell as Marsha Cole and Ann Wedgeworth as the Saleswoman. The plot is similar, but the emphasis is more on suspense. Marsha is in denial of her identity and wants to be truly human, unlike the Marsha in the original, who simply forgot who she was and accepted her return.\n\nIn 2008, the original episode was adapted as a graphic novel, Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone: The After Hours, written by Mark Kneece and illustrated by Rebekah Isaacs.[2]\n\nIn March 2025, the television series Severance aired an episode called The After Hours. This episode, the penultimate episode of season two, offers an homage to the earlier show by referring to Marsha White, a gold thimble, and the specialties department on the ninth floor.",

Refusing to believe him, Victoria snatches the tape away from him and throws it into the fire, and promptly begins to feel faint. She realizes too late he was telling the truth, and disappears as the flames consume the tape. Frantic, Gregory rushes to his dictation machine and begins to re-describe Victoria.

Mary appears and fixes her husband a drink, apparently lacking any memory of her previous interval of existence.\n\nRod Serling then appears on the set and says, \"We hope you enjoyed tonight's romantic story on The Twilight Zone. At the same time, we want you to realize that it was, of course, purely fictional. In real life, such ridiculous nonsense could never—\"\n\n\"Rod, you shouldn't!\" interrupts Gregory, who walks over to his safe and pulls out a tape marked \"Rod Serling.\" \"I mean, you shouldn't say such things as 'nonsense' and 'ridiculous!'\" he continues as he throws the envelope into the fire.\n\nLeaving Mr. Gregory West—still shy, quiet, very happy... and apparently in complete control of The Twilight Zone.\n\nWriter Richard Matheson had previously written a short story, And Now I'm Waiting, in which a male narrator visiting an author discovers that he is an invention of the author. The story had a much darker tone and finish in its original form, and ultimately, Matheson chose to rework it into a domestic comedy when he pitched it as an episode to the series. Previously unreleased, the original story was ultimately published in Twilight Zone Magazine in April 1983.[1]\n\nAlthough Serling appeared on-screen at the end of most first season Twilight Zone episodes to plug the following week's show, this is the only episode in the first season in which Rod Serling appears on-screen within the episode itself (i.e., not in a separate \"coming next week\" segment) and directly interacts with a character from the episode. From the second season onward, Serling began to appear on-screen at the start of each episode.[citation needed]\n\nKeenan Wynn was the son of vaudeville comedian Ed Wynn, who played Bookman in \"One for the Angels\" and Sam Forstmann in \"Ninety Years Without Slumbering\".

Embry collapses in the sand, and it is revealed that he is apparently hospitalized and suffering hallucinations, 17 years after the crash.\n\nConfident that Embry will recover, two doctors discuss their speculation that his suffering has been triggered by a newspaper headline. The paper has reported the desert discovery of the long-lost King Nine, which had not returned to base from a wartime mission in 1943. Having come down with a fever just before he was to board the ill-fated flight, Embry had been replaced on the mission by another captain. Seeing the headline has triggered survivor guilt, the intensity of which has caused him to imagine himself at the crash site.\n\nThe doctors assure Embry he has returned to the site only in his mind.

The answer is waiting for us in - The Twilight Zone.\n\nThis was the first episode to feature the familiar Marius Constant Twilight Zone theme. The score by Fred Steiner was later used in other Twilight Zone episodes.\n\nThe episode was based on the discovery of the B-24 Liberator bomber Lady Be Good and her crew's remains, which had crash-landed at night, deep in the Libyan desert after running out of fuel, while returning from a World War II bombing mission over Naples, Italy. In the episode, the marker of a grave of a member of the crew of King Nine is dated \"5 April 1943,\" the day on which the Lady Be Good was lost.  Lady Be Good had been found in 1958, and the bodies of eight of the nine-man crew were discovered between February and August 1960 – the eighth crewman being found just a few weeks before \"King Nine Will Not Return\" aired.\n\nThe bomber aircraft used in this episode was  a North American Aviation B-25C-10NA 42-32354, which still exists in storage with Aero Trader, Borrego Springs, California.[1]\n\n\"King Nine Will Not Return\" was adapted into short story form by Walter B.

On this planet or wherever there is human life—perhaps out amongst the stars—beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Lesson to be learned in the Twilight Zone.\n\nBecause of the complex makeup and camera angles, this was one of the most difficult episodes of The Twilight Zone to film.[1] The director, Douglas Heyes, wanted the show to feature actors with sympathetic voices. To achieve this, he cast the episode with his back to the performers.[2] Maxine Stuart spoke all the lines of the main character Janet Tyler, when her head is entirely covered by bandages.\n\nThe original title for this episode was \"Eye of the Beholder\". Stuart Reynolds, a television producer, threatened to sue writer and producer Rod Serling for the use of the title. At the time, Reynolds was selling an educational film of the same name to public schools. Reruns following the initial broadcast featured the title screen \"The Private World of Darkness\". Because CBS consulted different prints over the years for syndication packages, the closing credits for this episode vary from one title to the other, depending on which television station is using which package. In The Twilight Zone's original DVD release the syndicated version was marketed as an \"alternate version\". Other than the appearance of the title in the closing credits, however, there are no differences between the two versions.[3]\n\nSerling, who wrote the episode, reused the theme for a later teleplay, \"The Different Ones\", for his series Night Gallery. \"The Different Ones\" takes place in a futuristic world where a disfigured hermit teenage boy is sent on a NASA rocket to a planet where the inhabitants are revealed to look like him. During the transfer he meets a conventionally handsome alien youth, who is going to Earth because of his own \"disfigurement\".\n\nThis episode was remade for the 2002–03 revival of the series using Serling's original script (but discarding Bernard Herrmann's original score), with Molly Sims as Janet Tyler, Reggie Hayes as Dr. Bernardi and Roger Cross as the Leader. The make-up was changed to make the faces look more melted, ghoulish and decayed with deep ridges. The remake follows the original script more faithfully. The projection screens were changed to plasma screens and more of the dialogue from the Leader's monologue was used.",

Jana is convinced that she was built not to be a beloved daughter, but to be merely a prop. She exclaims \"I'm a machine\" and repeatedly bangs her arm against a railing while yelling \"No pain!\" She becomes conscious of the fact that she cannot even feel love. This discovery causes Jana such anguish that her \"father\" recognizes it is not possible for her to go on this way. At some point later, the Lorens are seen relaxing as before, but it is revealed that Dr. Loren has erased Jana's identity and memory and now utilizes her as a replacement for the maid known as Nelda, who gave Mrs. Loren daily shoulder massages.\n\nLet this be the postscript — Should you be worn out by the rigors of competing in a very competitive world, if you're distraught from having to share your existence with the noises and neuroses of the twentieth century, if you crave serenity but want it full time and with no strings attached, get yourself a workroom in the basement, and then drop a note to Dr. and Mrs. William Loren.

Dundee meets them at the station, where he and Flaherty find empty cans in Corwin's sack. Angry at having his time wasted, Dundee accuses Flaherty of incompetence; when Dundee challenges Corwin to produce a bottle of cherry brandy, vintage 1903, Corwin does just that, and is set free. He continues to distribute gifts until midnight, when the bag is empty.\n\nA man named Burt, whose desired pipe and smoking jacket comes from Corwin's bag, points out that Corwin himself has not received a gift. Corwin says that if he had his choice of any gift at all, \"I think I'd wish I could do this every year.\" Returning to the alley where the gift-laden bag had presented itself, he encounters an elf sitting in a large reindeer-hauled sleigh, waiting for him. Realizing that his wish has come true and he is now the real Santa Claus, Corwin sits in the sleigh and sets off with the elf.\n\nEmerging drunkenly from the precinct, Flaherty and Dundee look upward upon hearing bells and see Corwin ascending into the night sky. Dundee invites Flaherty to accompany him home and share some hot coffee, with brandy poured in it, adding, \"...and we'll thank God for miracles, Flaherty...\" The episode ends with a shot of the bag sitting next to the trash can Corwin originally found it in.\n\nA word to the wise to all the children of the twentieth century, whether their concern be pediatrics or geriatrics, whether they crawl on hands and knees and wear diapers or walk with a cane and comb their beards.

The 1944 Cerf anecdote features instead a young New York woman visiting the Carolina plantation of distant relatives, with the hearse's coachman eventually revealed to be the operator of a medical building elevator that plummets when its cables break. In the 1944 film, Dead of Night, the protagonist is again male, also with the name Hugh Grainger, haunted by a man driving a hearse, and has a premonition about a fatal bus crash.",

However, the air traffic controller on the radio does not understand their technological references. The controller eventually clears the aircraft to land at LaGuardia, but orders the captain to report to the CAA office afterward; the captain remarks that they haven't called the Federal Aviation Agency by that name in years. The copilot spots the buildings and structures from the New York World's Fair of 1939 below, making the crew realize that they did come back, but \"not far enough\".\n\nThe captain attempts one more ascent before the fuel runs out, in an effort to return the plane to 1961.

However, Haley reveals that he is a three-eyed alien scout from Venus and that his colonists have intercepted the Martian fleet.\n\nIncident on a small island, to be believed or disbelieved. However, if a sour-faced dandy named Ross or a big, good-natured counterman who handles a spatula as if he'd been born with one in his mouth, – if either of these two entities walk onto your premises, you'd better hold their hands – all three of them – or check the color of their eyes – all three of them.

Wordsworth agrees to do so and gives him the key to unlock the door. The Chancellor flees from the room just before the bomb explodes, killing Wordsworth. Due to his cowardly display in Wordsworth's room and invocation of God, the Chancellor is replaced by his own subaltern and declared obsolete.

          "plot": "The woman tracks him down, and they wander down the street, coming to a movie theater. He stares at a poster for a wartime romance film and turns to smile at her. They find the skeletal remains of soldiers at the theater entrance and abruptly grab the rifles of the dead owners, simultaneously aiming at each other. After a tense moment, the man turns and walks away, slinging his weapon over his shoulder.\n\nThe woman follows him, and the two walk along the city street. They stop in front of a store with a cocktail dress in the smashed display window. Upon her saying \"Prekrasnyy\" (Russian for \"beautiful\"), he hands the dress to her and tells her to put it on. She enters an office next to the department store to change into the dress, but then she notices the jingoistic enlistment posters on the wall and realizes it is a recruiting office for the other side. She grabs her rifle, exits the office and angrily shoots at the man twice, but misses. He gets up, looks at her incredulously, and walks away.\n\nThe next morning, the man has changed out of his uniform into a tuxedo without a shirt and has found two jars of peaches. He sees the woman waiting for him, peeking up from behind a truck in the street below. He yells at her to leave, to \"take your war to more suitable companions.\" She steps out into the street, wearing the dress. He joins her, tosses one of the jars to her and says \"Prekrasnyy\". She smiles, and the two walk away together.\n\nThis has been ... a love story, about two lonely people who found each other ... in the Twilight Zone.\n\nAn abbreviated version of the music for this episode, composed by Nathan Van Cleave, served as the basis for the opening and closing music for the radio drama CBS Radio Mystery Theater. The episode relies heavily on the music as there is very little dialogue throughout.\n\nThis episode was filmed on the backlot of Hal Roach Studios in Culver City, California, which was falling apart due to mismanagement and disuse (the facilities were finally torn down in 1963). Very little set decoration was needed to create the illusion of an abandoned city. The interior bracing that holds up the facade is visible through the second story windows in the opening shots of the episode and the credits.\n\nThe sound for the \"blaster\" was taken from Forbidden Planet, where Robby the Robot exclaims that an Earthman's weapon was \"a simple blaster\".[1]",

          "plot": "To prove his hypothesis, as well as to break the illusion, Sheckly proposes a simple, yet potentially fatal, test: he will put his arm in the arc of the plane's turning propeller. Despite their objections, he convinces the staff to go along with it, and Robbins starts the plane's engines. After some hesitation, Sheckly places his arm directly into the spinning propeller; just as he predicted, his arm remains unharmed, and the plane vanishes. However, when Sheckly successively turns to the others, he is met only with silence as they each disappear, just as the plane did.\n\nCalling out for the staff, Sheckly makes his way back to the Operations room where he finds Bengston and Malloy, only to discover that they have no recollection of the empty plane or Sheckly's investigation. When asked, Bengston states that Flight 107 landed safely with full crew and passengers and shows him a newspaper article to prove it. But as Sheckly continues to press them about losing \"Flight 107\", Bengston remembers that the only plane the airline ever lost was a Flight 107, 17 or 18 years previously. The case had been investigated by Sheckly but was never solved, the only case he never figured out, closed as \"presumed crashed for reasons unknown\" at sea. Sheckly staggers away and wanders through the airfield he calls out, demanding to know the fate of Flight 107, then slumps onto the ramp as the sound of an aircraft's jet engine is heard passing overhead.\n\nPicture of a man with an Achilles' heel, a mystery that landed in his life and then turned into a heavy weight, dragged across the years to ultimately take the form of an illusion. Now, that's the clinical answer that they put on the tag as they take him away. But if you choose to think that the explanation has to do with an airborne Flying Dutchman, a ghost ship on a fog-enshrouded night on a flight that never ends, then you're doing your business in an old stand in the Twilight Zone.\n\n\"The show now seems to be feeding off itself. Last Friday's episode, unless it proves to be an exception in the new skein, doesn't augur well for the future of the series. Twilight Zone seems to be running dry of inspiration.\" —from the Variety review.\n\n”You should track down the episode.

          "plot": "In just a moment, you will enter a strange province that knows neither North nor South, a place we call—The Twilight Zone.\n\nAt the end of the Civil War, a Confederate Army Sergeant walks down a road aided by a wooden crutch. He carries with him a dirty bed roll and a homemade guitar. The limping Sergeant comes across a ruined antebellum mansion which belongs to Lavinia Godwin, a Southern belle whose husband was killed in the war and whose bitterness toward the Union Army still survives.\n\nThe Sergeant receives permission from Lavinia to sit on a bench under a dead tree in her front yard. He plays his guitar, and Lavinia recognizes the tune as one that her husband used to sing. The two watch as soldiers belonging to both the Union and the Confederacy pass by the house and continue down the road. The Sergeant learns about Lavinia's illness and her husband's death.\n\nAs they reminisce, a Union Lieutenant on horseback stops by the home to ask for water. The Sergeant recognizes him as the man that saved his life in the war. Meanwhile, Lavinia retrieves an old shotgun and fires at the Lieutenant. The blast passes through him and he remarks that nothing matters anymore. The Sergeant then remembers that the man who saved his life was killed. He gives the Lieutenant a drink from the well and the soldier continues on his way.\n\nThe night passes and the Sergeant begins to understand that this is not a normal road and these are not ordinary wounded soldiers. He tells Lavinia that there is something at the end of the road he has to find. As the Sergeant turns to leave, Lavinia tries to persuade him to stay. They then hear a man's voice singing the same song the Sergeant had played earlier on his guitar − it is Lavinia's husband, Jud.\n\nJud reveals to Lavinia that everyone on the road is indeed dead, including her. The Sergeant, understanding Jud's words, sighs and begins to walk down the road, but Lavinia refuses to believe. Jud tells her that there is nothing left for him in that house. Jud rejects her pleas and continues his journey, reassuring her that he will wait for her at the end of the road.\n\nLavinia is then comforted by a lone passerby, who turns out to be Abraham Lincoln, the last casualty of the Civil War. Lincoln quotes a line from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, before Lavinia runs to join her husband:\n\nOf all the wonders that I yet have heard, \nIt seems to me most strange that men should fear, \nSeeing that death, a necessary end,\nWill come when it will come.\n\nIncident on a dirt road during the month of April, the year 1865. As we've already pointed out, it's a road that won't be found on a map, but it's one of many that lead in and out of the Twilight Zone.\n\nThe traditional folk song \"Black Is the Color (Of My True Love's Hair)\" is featured prominently throughout this episode.",

Throughout the game, Fats laments that Jesse has done nothing with his life but play pool, explaining that he himself lived a full life in addition to becoming a great player. Jesse ignores Fats, convinced that he is just trying to distract him.\n\nWith one ball left on the table and both men needing to sink it in order to win, Fats misses his shot on purpose, and he warns Jesse that he may get more than he bargained for if he wins the game. Jesse sinks the ball and revels in his victory, now secure in his status as the best pool player of all time. Fats thanks Jesse for beating him, leading Jesse to angrily call him a sore loser, before Fats disappears.\n\nLong after his own death, Jesse is summoned from the afterlife to travel to Mason's Pool Hall in Sandusky, Ohio, to play against a challenger. Known even in death as the greatest pool player ever, Jesse has no choice but to face an endless series of would-be successors until someone beats him and claims his title. Meanwhile Fats has gone fishing, relieved of his obligation.\n\nMr. Jesse Cardiff, who became a legend by beating one, but who has found out after his funeral that being the best of anything carries with it a special obligation to keep on proving it. Mr. Fats Brown, on the other hand, having relinquished the champion's mantle, has gone fishing. These are the ground rules in the Twilight Zone.\n\nWe've had some performances of great depth on The Twilight Zone, and next week is no exception.

This is a story of a tyrant and his assassins, a shattered dream, and the death of a cause. Next week on The Twilight Zone, The Mirror.\n\nGeorge Clayton Johnson's script originally featured an ending in which Jesse loses the game and yet finds himself still alive. Seeing this, Fats explains that he will die \"as all second-raters die: you'll be buried and forgotten without me touching you. If you'd beaten me, you'd have lived forever.\" Fats disappears, while Jesse vows to keep practicing until he is good enough to face the champion again.\n\nThe episode was remade in the 1980s version of The Twilight Zone.

          "plot": "One night each week, Anthony gives the townsfolk one hour of television, which he creates and projects onto the family TV set. The adults gather around in the Fremonts' living room, squirming uncomfortably as Anthony shows them a vision of battling dinosaurs with ample gore. Unable to voice their real feelings, they tell Anthony that it was far better than what used to be on television.\n\nAfterwards, the adults celebrate their friend Dan Hollis's birthday. He gets two presents from his wife;— a bottle of brandy, one of only five bottles of liquor left in the village, and a Perry Como record. Dan is eager to listen to the record, but he is reminded by everyone that Anthony does not like singing. Getting drunk from the brandy, he starts complaining about the miserable state of the town, not being able to listen to the record, and no one singing \"Happy Birthday\" to him. Dan snaps and confronts the child, calling him a monster and a murderer. While Anthony's anger grows, Dan yells for someone to attack him from behind and end his reign of terror. Aunt Amy (who is not able to sing anymore because of Anthony) tentatively reaches for a fireplace poker, but no one dares to act. Anthony angrily taunts Dan for being a \"bad man\" and transforming him into a jack-in-the-box, causing his wife to break down. The adults are horrified at what Anthony has done, and his father asks him to wish Dan into the cornfield, which Anthony does.\n\nAnthony then causes snow to begin falling outside. The snow will kill off at least half the crops and the town will face starvation. Anthony's father starts to rebuke Anthony about this, but his wife and the other adults look on with worried smiles on their faces. The intimidated father then smiles and tells Anthony \"...But it's good that you're making it snow, Anthony, it's real good. And tomorrow...tomorrow's gonna be a real good day!\"\n\nNo comment here. No comment at all. We only wanted to introduce you to one of our very special citizens, little Anthony Fremont, age 6, who lives in a village called Peaksville, in a place that used to be Ohio. And if by some strange chance you should run across him, you had best think only good thoughts. Anything less than that is handled at your own risk. Because if you do meet Anthony, you can be sure of one thing: you have entered the Twilight Zone.\n\nRod Serling then appears on camera to promote the next episode - \"This is the lobby of an inn in a small Bavarian town, and next week we'll enter it with a former SS officer. It's the first stop on his road back to relive a horror that was Nazi Germany. Mr. Joseph Schildkraut and Mr. Oscar Beregi demonstrate what happens to the monster when it is judged by the victim. Our feeling here is that this is a stark and moving a piece of drama as we have ever presented. I very much hope that you're around to make your own judgment.\"\n\nTime named this the third-best Twilight Zone episode, behind \"Time Enough at Last\" and \"The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street\".[1]\n\nRod Serling's introduction at the beginning of this episode was recycled and digitally edited for the preshow of the Disney Parks attraction The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror. In the preshow video, Serling stands in front of a service elevator door, rather than a map of the United States, and explains to guests the journey they are about to experience. The attraction, which first opened at Disney-MGM Studios in 1994, almost two decades after Serling's death, is an homage to the original series with an original story based on it. When conceiving the attraction, Disney Imagineers wanted to include Serling in the attraction and opted for a voice artist to play him; Mark Silverman was chosen by Serling's widow to provide his voice.[2] A poster advertising \"Anthony Fremont's Orchestra\" is displayed next to the concierge desk in the lobby of the attraction, an ironic reference to Anthony's hatred of singing.\n\nThe opening narration of this episode is sampled in \"Threatened\" by Michael Jackson in his 2001 album, Invincible.\n\nIn a 1974 interview with Marvel Comics, Rod Serling said \"I'm on my third draft of a feature film based on Jerome Bixby's short story, 'It's a Good Life'. We did it originally on Twilight Zone, but now we're doing a full-length version. Alan Landsburg, who produced Chariots of the Gods, is producing it. It's in the fantasy-horror genre.\"[4] This was one of Serling's last interviews before his death in 1975.\n\nTwilight Zone: The Movie's \"It's a Good Life\" segment is a remake of the original episode, and is directed by Joe Dante.",

          "plot": "Lutze supposes that Becker is now the caretaker of the camp, which Becker confirms \"in a manner of speaking.\" As they talk, Becker relentlessly confronts Lutze with the reality of his grossly inhumane actions, while Lutze insists that he was only following orders. Lutze tries to dismiss Becker's description of cruelty by saying that the war is over and that he has moved on.\n\nLutze tries to leave, but finds the gate locked. Becker asks why he came back, given that he changed his name and fled to South America. Lutze argues that he hoped that with the passage of enough time, the world would have moved on and people would be willing to forget his \"little mistakes of the past.\" Becker retorts that Lutze's actions were not mistakes, but crimes against humanity.\n\nBecker and a dozen other ghostly inmates put Lutze on trial for his actions, which include ordering the deaths of over 1,700 innocent people without trial or due process, maiming and torturing thousands of human beings without provocation, the criminal experimentation on women and children, the murder of at least 14 people by his own hand, and calling and signing into effect orders for the gassing and cremating of one million human beings. Lutze screams and passes out.\n\nUpon awaking, Lutze tells Becker he imagined the trial. Becker contradicts this, and informs Lutze of the guilty verdict. When Becker is about to pronounce the sentence to the court, Lutze mocks him as mad until he suddenly remembers that on the night American troops came close to Dachau 17 years before, he personally killed Becker and several other inmates and attempted to burn down the camp.\n\nAs punishment, Lutze is made to undergo the same horrors he imposed on the inmates in the form of tactile illusions, including being shot by machine guns at the gate, hanging by the gallows and torture at the detention building. He screams in agony from the illusions and collapses. Before departing, Becker's ghost informs him, \"This is not hatred. This is retribution. This is not revenge. This is justice. But this is only the beginning, Captain. Only the beginning. Your final judgment will come from God.\"\n\nIt is made clear that what truly happened was an hallucination caused by Lutze’s own repressed guilt and all the ghosts were figments created by his own mind, and Becker was just a direct representation of his own thoughts about his past actions and behaviour. Lutze is found by authorities, sedated by a doctor, and taken to a mental institution, since he continues to experience and react to his illusory sufferings. His finders wonder how a man who was perfectly calm two hours before could have gone insane so soon. The doctor then looks around and says, \"Dachau. Why does it still stand? Why do we keep it standing?\"\n\nThere is an answer to the doctor's question. All the Dachaus must remain standing. The Dachaus, the Belsens, the Buchenwalds, the Auschwitzes; all of them. They must remain standing because they are a monument to a moment in time when some men decided to turn the Earth into a graveyard. Into it they shoveled all of their reason, their logic, their knowledge, but worst of all, their conscience. And the moment we forget this, the moment we cease to be haunted by its remembrance, then we become the gravediggers. Something to dwell on and to remember, not only in the Twilight Zone but wherever men walk God's Earth.\n\nThe introduction to the instrumental song \"Intro to Reality\" from the 1990 album Persistence of Time by the heavy metal band Anthrax featured dialogue spoken by the character Alfred Becker quoting, \"We did as we were told.\" and \"They just heard you offer the apology for all the monsters of our times.\" spoken to Lutze from this episode. The instrumental segues into the next song, \"Belly of The Beast\" which is a tribute to the story itself from Becker's point of view.",

The streets are deserted, water usage is limited to an hour a day, and their electricity is gradually being turned off. Food and water are scarce and the sea has dried up. A radio presenter announces that the police have been moved out of the city and that citizens must defend themselves against looters, then angrily goes off script before being forcibly taken off the air.\n\nAs the temperature rises to 120 °F (49 °C), the two women grow weaker. Norma burns her hand on a windowsill. Mrs. Bronson becomes psychologically unstable, beseeching Norma to paint a picture of a cool subject, rather than Norma's usual paintings of the Sun and burning cities. A looter enters the building through the roof door, which Mrs. Bronson neglected to lock. They hide in Norma's apartment. The looter calls from outside, demanding entry. Norma threatens him with a revolver, and they hear him walk away.\n\nAgainst Norma's pleas, Mrs. Bronson unlocks the door, and the stranger forces his way in, grabs the revolver and drinks their water. He calms down after seeing their distress and begs for their forgiveness, claiming that he is an honest man driven insane by the heat. He throws away the revolver and describes the recent death of his wife and newborn child. He begs for forgiveness until Norma acknowledges him; he then leaves the building.\n\nIn an attempt to console Mrs. Bronson, Norma shows her an oil painting of a waterfall cascading into a lush pond. Mrs. Bronson deliriously claims that she can feel the coolness and splashes in the imaginary waters before dying from heat stroke. Norma sits in shock as the thermometer surges past 130 °F (54 °C) and shatters. The paint on the paintings begins to melt; she screams and collapses.\n\nThe scene cuts to the same apartment at night with heavy snow outside the windows. The thermometer reads −10 °F (−23 °C). Norma, who has been bedridden with a high fever, is being cared for by a doctor and Mrs. Bronson. The Earth moving closer to the Sun is revealed to be only a fever dream, while in reality the Earth is moving away from the Sun, and the world's inhabitants are actually freezing to death.\n\nNorma tells Mrs. Bronson about her nightmare, adding, \"Isn't it wonderful to have darkness, and coolness?\" Mrs. Bronson's face stiffens in dread, and she replies, \"Yes, my dear. It's...wonderful.\"\n\nThe poles of fear, the extremes of how the Earth might conceivably be doomed. Minor exercise in the care and feeding of a nightmare, respectfully submitted by all the thermometer-watchers - in the Twilight Zone.\n\nRod Serling then appears on camera to promote the next episode: \"Next week we move back into time, back to 1863. A distinguished actor, Mr. Gary Merrill plays the role of a Confederate scout who goes off on a patrol and winds up smack dab in the center of The Twilight Zone. Our story is an adaptation of a strange tale by Manly Wade Wellman called 'The Still Valley'. This one is for Civil War buffs and the students of the occult. I hope you're around to take a look at it.\"\n\nThe effect of the oil paintings melting was accomplished by painting the pictures in wax on the surface of a hotplate. Moreover, the episode was shot in the summer, on a set without air-conditioning, with the director actually turning up the heat on certain key scenes to create the necessary mood and appearance for the story.[1]\n\nSerling's original script featured two characters who did not appear in the completed episode: a police officer and a refrigerator repairman.[1]",

Sergeant Joseph Paradine hears the troops approaching, but suddenly the sound stops. He decides to descend into the valley to see the cause for himself. His companion refuses to accompany him.\n\nWhen Paradine gets into town, he finds the troops there, but all of them are motionless, frozen in time. He tries unsuccessfully to wake them. Finally he comes across an old man named Teague, the sole remaining inhabitant of the town, who is unaffected by the strange phenomenon. Teague claims to be a \"witch-man\" and says he used a magic spell to freeze the soldiers. Paradine does not believe him, so Teague casts the spell on Paradine, freezing him.\n\nWhen Teague lifts the spell on Paradine, he claims that he could stop the entire Union Army in this manner, ensuring the success of the Confederacy. Paradine asks why he has not done so, and Teague replies that he is dying and will be dead by the day's end. He gives his book of spells to Paradine, encouraging him to use it, but when Paradine looks in it, he realizes that using this magic would require him to align himself with Satan, which Teague acknowledges.\n\nTeague dies, and Paradine returns to camp to tell his superior about what happened. The superior does not believe him and orders him to get some rest. When another scout returns to report that an entire company of Union troops is standing frozen near the camp, Paradine reveals that he cast a spell on them from the book. Once he describes his encounter with the old man, his superior urges him to continue reading from the book since Satan may be the only ally who can help the Confederacy win the war.\n\nParadine discovers that using the book's magic requires that not only must he praise the name of the Devil, but he must renounce the name of God. Rather than do either, Paradine throws the book into a campfire, saying that if the Confederacy is to die, it should be buried in hallowed ground. The next day, Paradine receives orders that his unit is going to march to Gettysburg.\n\nOn the following morning, Sergeant Paradine and the rest of these men were moved up north to a little town in Pennsylvania, an obscure little place where a battle was brewing, a town called Gettysburg, and this one was fought without the help of the Devil.

A week later, Mulligan has found a new appreciation for life in 1890, but Rollo is dismayed at the lack of technology and modern comforts.

He says that he is happy because he is well paid, enjoys his work, and likes his two employers. When Fitzgerald protests that he treats Marvin poorly, Marvin reveals he finds his ego and temper amusing, to the point where he frequently has to restrain himself from laughing aloud. Again, this change ends when the tune does.\n\nFitzgerald suspects that the piano makes people reveal their innermost thoughts depending on what particular song is played. He tests it further by playing a roll for Khachaturian's \"Sabre Dance\"[1] on the piano for Esther. She says she hates him and believes that he married her because he wanted someone to bully rather than love. She attributes her marrying him to youthful naïveté. Satisfied with the piano's performance, Fitzgerald decides to use it on the birthday party guests.\n\nThe first guest to arrive is the playwright Gregory Walker. Gregory professes a distaste for any emotional involvement, but Fitzgerald plays a roll for \"These Foolish Things (Remind Me of You).\"[1] As it plays, Gregory admits to strong feelings for Esther and even confesses that they had a tryst while she was on vacation. Esther enters and is mortified and implores Fitzgerald not to play the piano to the other guests.\n\nThe rest of the guests arrive. Marge Moore is the life of the party, enjoying the food and company while making jokes about her heavyset figure. When no one immediately volunteers for Fitzgerald's \"party game,\" he picks Marge as the first to listen to the piano. As the piano plays Debussy's \"Clair de lune\",[1] Marge goes into a trance, identifying herself as a little girl named Tina who loves to dance ballet. Fitzgerald encourages her to demonstrate, and she does so, prompting laughter from all of the party guests except Esther and Gregory. With further prompting, Marge speaks dreamily about her desire to be a tiny, \"perfectly formed\" snowflake, melting in the hand of a man who loves her. The guests stop laughing while Fortune continues to roar with glee. The song ends, and a humiliated Marge takes her seat.\n\nFitzgerald has Esther insert a new roll, which he claims will \"bring out the devil\" among them. He hands her a roll for the song \"Melody in F,\" but she secretly switches rolls.  The piano begins to play Brahms's Lullaby.  The music makes Fitzgerald speak in a petulant, frightened voice. At the guests' prompting, he admits that, deep down, he is a frightened child who lashes out at everyone and hurts them because it's the only means of expressing himself he knows and fears they will hurt him first if he doesn't. He confesses that he humiliated Marge because he is jealous of her eagerness for life despite her insecurities and deliberately wrote bad reviews of Gregory's plays out of pure spite when he should have praised them because he's jealous of his talent.\n\nFeeling pity for him, the guests leave without comment. Fitzgerald makes his final confession: he treated Esther with coldness and cruelty because he lacks the emotional maturity to receive and reciprocate her love. Gregory asks Esther to leave with him, and she does so, leaving Fitzgerald alone.\n\nFitzgerald, distraught at being abandoned, feels insulted and throws a tantrum, destroying furniture and decorations in the room. He ends his tirade by ripping the roll from the piano, ending the piano's spell on him. As he kneels on the ground, Marvin enters; remembering his earlier confession, Fitzgerald tells Marvin not to laugh at him. A somber Marvin replies, \"I'm not laughing, Mr. Fortune. You're not funny anymore.\"\n\nMr. Fitzgerald Fortune, a man who went searching for concealed persons and found himself in the Twilight Zone.",

He proposes to her, but before she can respond to his proposal, angry townspeople arrive to confront the demon they believe is possessing Jeff. They demand that he leave. He insists that Comfort answer his proposal first, and she tells him yes, and that she is willing to go anywhere to be with him. Jeff then makes an inspired speech in which he tells them that they are wrong and have nothing to fear from him. He also slyly threatens that if they are right, it might be in their best interests to be nice to him. They nervously accept the wisdom of this, and promise to attend Jeff and Comfort's wedding.\n\nAfter the mob disperses, Comfort asks Jeff if he could really do the things he threatened them with, to which he replies that he was lying.

          "summary": "When two astronauts (Claude Akins, Joe Maross) land on a distant planet, one of them becomes a \"God\" to a race of tiny people.",
          "plot": "Later, Fletcher finds that Craig had coerced the tiny people to build a life-size statue of him. Fletcher tells Craig that the repairs are done and they can depart. Craig pulls a gun on Fletcher and orders Fletcher to leave the planet without him. Fletcher does his best to talk Craig into coming along, telling him he'll be lonely, but Craig fires at the statue, blowing off the head, and again orders him to leave. Fletcher leaves in disgust. Craig gloats and throws the broken-off head of the statue at the city, cackling maniacally as tiny voices cry out in panic and tiny sirens wail.\n\nAnother ship lands and two spacemen, taller than the mountains, emerge. They too are repairing their ship. Craig shouts at them to go away, claiming, \"Don't you understand?! I am the god! I am the god, don't you understand?! I am the god!\" One of them notices and picks Craig up to examine him, unintentionally crushing him to death. He casually discards the body and the two giant spacemen leave. The little people rejoice at his death, pulling the statue of Craig down on top of his lifeless body.\n\nThe case of navigator Peter Craig, a victim of a delusion. In this case, the dream dies a little harder than the man. A small exercise in space psychology that you can try on for size - in the Twilight Zone.\n\nIn an interview with Twilight Zone historian Marc Zicree, series producer Buck Houghton discussed the final scene in which the giant astronauts appear and stand towering behind the mountains in the foreground. He explained that this was an optically composited matte shot which combined new footage of the two actors playing the \"giants\" with stock location footage of the real mountains around Death Valley, which had originally been filmed two years earlier for the Season 1 episode \"I Shot an Arrow into the Air\".\n\nLike many other installments of Twilight Zone episodes, this episode used several props and costumes originally created for MGM's Forbidden Planet. In this case, the sidearms worn by the two Earth astronauts are two of the Forbidden Planet \"blaster pistols\", and the two \"giants\" who appear in the final scene are wearing C-57D crew tunics (with different belts).\n\nOne particularly unusual item is seen during Act I, when Claude Akins' character is shown working on a device he evidently has taken out of the rocket for repair. The design, level of detail and standard of workmanship is highly suggestive of classic-era MGM props department manufacture, and it does bear some resemblance to other items originally crafted for Forbidden Planet. The hyperbolic plexiglass cover Akins removes at the beginning of the scene is very similar in shape to the conical dome on the head of Robby the Robot although it is considerably smaller. This cover protects a small \"radar dish\" device which is mounted on gimbals (and was probably motor-driven). This prop's general appearance – the frontal \"radome\", plexiglass \"windows\" and a small insignia visible on the side – suggests that it may have been built as the nose-cone of some large-scale miniature prop – possibly a futuristic aircraft or spaceship? - although its provenance and what it was originally built for is currently unknown.\n\nIn Dennis Etchison's Twilight Zone Radio Dramas adaptation starring Daniel J. Travanti as Fletcher, the name of the \"Craig\" character was changed to \"Knopf\" and the character of a talking ship's computer with a female personality was added.\n\nThe American television series The Simpsons paid homage to \"The Little People\" in the episode \"Treehouse of Horror VII\", parodying it in the segment \"The Genesis Tub\".[1] The segment sees Lisa Simpson putting one of her baby teeth in a petri dish of cola for a school science project, but, thanks to the interference of her brother Bart, causes the creation of a society of microscopic beings living within the tooth, who see Lisa as God, while they see Bart as the Devil for destroying part of their ecosystem with his finger. The segment's inspiration from \"The Little People\" is further referenced in the animated series South Park, in the episode \"The Simpsons Already Did It\".",

Crangle tells him of his plan to shrink every evil person at 4 o'clock that afternoon through sheer force of will, mentioning his belief about a global conspiracy involving the evil people of the world. He also mentions that he has tried such feats before (trying to turn wheels into triangle shapes due to believing that evil uses public transportation to move). He believes that by shrinking all evil people to two feet tall, that they will be unable to carry on their everyday lives and eventually become extinct. Hall asks Crangle if he has ever had any psychiatric help and tells Crangle that they do not need his kind of help because they have the law. Hall says that both support and help in upholding the law are appreciated, but what Crangle is doing is instead interference. Crangle accuses him of being in on the conspiracy. As Hall leaves, Crangle screams at him that he too will be two feet tall in just 20 minutes. When 4 o'clock rolls around, Crangle gloats on his imminent triumph to Pete, who calls out \"nut\" but then adds, \"Certainly, Peter. This is kind of a celebration.\" Crangle is then horrified to find that he himself has been shrunk to two feet tall. As he struggles in vain to get up to his windowsill before collapsing in anguish, Pete calls out the word \"nut\" one last time, implying that he had been insulting Crangle by calling him a \"nut\" the entire time.\n\nIn the radio adaptation starring Stan Freberg, the ending was altered to be more gruesome as Pete mistakes the now-shrunken Crangle for a \"nut\" and eats him.[1]\n\nAt four o'clock, an evil man made his bed and lay in it, a pot called a kettle black, a stone-thrower broke the windows of his glass house.

As he has taken longer than any other angel to do so, failure in this case means demotion.\n\nCavender appears beside Agnes on her bus ride home and tries to prove he is her guardian angel by changing the bus into a horse and buggy, then a convertible, and finally back to a bus. Once at home, Agnes is greeted by cookie-loving kids and neighbors who sympathize with her ongoing work woes. When she enters her apartment, she finds Cavender on her couch.\n\nHe provides her a mansion, high society friends, and a large bank account to fund it all. Instead of bowling, her former social \"high point\", she finds herself hosting a lavish party. However, she is uncomfortably overwhelmed by the high society chatter, largely incomprehensible to her, and by the obsequious affections of the men. Cavender, meanwhile, indulges himself in alcoholic drinks.\n\nCavender wakes up on Agnes' mansion couch. He does not see Agnes anywhere and zaps himself to her old apartment, where she glumly tells him that none of her old apartment neighbors recognize her. She tells him she does not want to go back to the mansion and wants her old life back. Cavender argues against the idea, but eventually gives in and zaps her back to her normal life. With excitement, she greets and jokes with all her old friends. She thanks Cavender and he realizes that she is \"the richest woman [he] know[s]\" and that money does not necessarily equal happiness.\n\nCavender returns to Heaven to see his boss, who reprimands him for his behavior at the party and for making no change to Agnes' life. However, after looking down on Earth, the boss sees that though her circumstances are unchanged, Agnes is now happy. He realizes Cavender did complete his mission by making Agnes appreciate what she had, and instead of being demoted, he will now help \"other deserving subjects\". Cavender takes out a cigar and happily leaves the 3rd Celestial Division Angel Placement.\n\nA word to the wise now to any and all who might suddenly feel the presence of a cigar-smoking helpmate who takes bankbooks out of thin air. If you're suddenly aware of any such celestial aids, it means that you're under the beneficent care of one Harmon Cavender, guardian angel. And this message from the Twilight Zone: Lotsa luck!\n\nThis episode was originally broadcast with a laugh track – the only Twilight Zone episode to feature one – because this episode was intended as a backdoor pilot for a regular comedy series featuring the Cavender character. The version included in The Twilight Zone – The Complete Definitive Collection DVD set has the laugh track removed. Reruns airing in the U.S. on Syfy and MeTV also have the laugh track removed as does the version on Netflix.\n\n\"Cavender Is Coming\" bears strong similarities to the first-season episode \"Mr. Bevis\". Both episodes are comedies about guardian angels who try to help kindhearted but hapless human beings by giving them everything they think they desire, only to discover that the humans are happier with the way life had been previously.

On the drive, Alan hears the electrical noises again, and this time is able to make out the sound of himself talking to a \"Walter\" among them. He tells Jessica to stop the car, runs out, and picks up a rock to kill her with. He fights back this urge and screams at Jessica to get as far away from him as possible. She reluctantly gets back in the car and drives off just as Alan's homicidal urge subsides. Disoriented by his frustrated urge to kill, he lingers in the road until a car hits him. The driver applies the brakes in enough time that Alan is not gravely hurt, but a deep cut in his wrist is bizarrely not bleeding. Alan peels back his \"skin\" to find metal rods and wiring underneath instead of flesh and bone.\n\nJessica calls Alan after he returns to the city. She is now convinced that he needs mental help and has made an appointment for him with a psychiatrist. He agrees to go with her to the appointment, but knows from his robotic arm that his problems go beyond mental issues. Intuiting that \"Walter Ryder\" is the key, he looks up Walter in a phone book and pays him an unannounced visit. Walter turns out to be his physical double. Walter explains that Alan is an android he developed using funds from a calculator he invented, using help from some of the world's greatest scientists, and his own self-professed genius. He created Alan's memory by using his own memories of Coeurville, which he left 20 years before, and filling in the blanks with a fictional aunt Mildred and a job at a fictional university. Alan was designed to be a perfect version of Walter - to be outgoing, bold and charming, while the real Walter is shy, self-pitying and socially awkward. Walter admits his scientific reach exceeded his grasp, and there are aspects of his creation which he does not understand. A week ago, Alan suddenly tried to kill Walter, stabbed him with a pair of scissors, and ran away.\n\nAlan is outraged that Walter created an artificial human without considering the consequences, in particular the situation with Jessica. Walter is sympathetic but has no idea how to even diagnose the cause of Alan's homicidal episodes, much less correct it, and points out that Alan has no chance of a normal life with Jessica anyway, since he doesn't age. Alan then demands that Walter replace him with a properly functioning android who will love and care for Jessica, and writes down her address for Walter on some scrap paper taken from his pocket. When he recognizes the scrap paper is the pamphlet the evangelist gave him, it triggers another malfunction and he tries to kill Walter.\n\nAfter the struggle, the survivor goes to Jessica and asks her to forget about his strange behavior of the past couple of days, saying that the nightmare is over and he will tell her what happened someday. In the final scene, it is revealed that the survivor is Walter and that Alan's broken form lies amid the wreckage of the laboratory.\n\nIn a way, it can be said that Walter Ryder succeeded in his life's ambition, even though the man he created was, after all, himself. There may be easier ways to self-improvement, but sometimes it happens that the shortest distance between two points is a crooked line – through the Twilight Zone.",

McClure goes down again to try to ascertain exactly where the sound is coming from, to help the rescue outfit determine where to enter the boat. The diver receives no response to his bangs on the hull, but he finds a dog tag which he delivers to Beecham. It belongs to Chief Bell.\n\nWhen Beecham shows the dog tag to Bell, he recounts that he was a signalman on a submarine during the war. He dropped a signal light while attempting to change the infrared filter at night, causing the filter to fall off. As a result, Japanese destroyers saw the light and attacked. Bell was blown into the water by the shelling. The captain ordered a dive, but depth charges sank the boat. Bell, the sole survivor, was later rescued by an American destroyer. Bell tells Beecham that he now understands: his dead shipmates know he is above them right now and are demanding that he join them. Bell is overcome by survivor guilt, and says, \"I sunk that sub. I'm responsible.\" Despite Captain Beecham's efforts to convince Bell that his mistake did nothing, that a boat caught on the surface and surrounded by enemy ships was already doomed, Bell dons the dog tag, races out on deck and jumps overboard, shouting, \"They're calling muster on me!\" The destroyer's crew are unable to save Bell or find his body.\n\nLater, McClure accompanies the rescue mission into the submarine. Upon returning to the ship, he reports to Beecham that the boat was a wreck inside, and no one was left alive. Inside the control room, he found the periscope shears cut in half, with one section swinging back and forth. When Beecham asks him to confirm that this was the clanging noise they had heard, McClure agrees, but adds that he also saw the remains of eight dead sailors; one was holding a hammer in his hand.\n\nSmall naval engagement, the month of April, 1963. Not to be found in any historical annals. Look for this one filed under 'H' for haunting in the Twilight Zone.\n\nThe exterior shots of the destroyer used in this episode were of USS Mullinnix while the interior shots were done on board the USS Edson.\n\n1.^ The only submarine numbered 714 to ever serve with the USN was the USS Norfolk (SSN-714), which wouldn't be made for 13 years after this episode. Additionally, no submarines were present at the battle. The newest American submarine at that time was USS Barb (SS-220), almost 500 boats earlier in the sequence.",

They show him some of the technology they have, including a replicator which can produce any object given its molecular formula and a ray which can reverse any injury, including death. The elders refuse to share this technology, given to the town 104 years earlier by a scientist from an unknown planet, until \"men learn the ways of peace.\" Philip rebukes them for decreeing themselves the sole people capable of using these extraterrestrial gifts responsibly, and for squandering technology that could be used to cure all illness and end hunger. The town elders insist that if they shared the technology it would be used for weapons, and tell Philip that due to his chance witnessing of the device used to make his dog disappear, he must either stay forever in Peaceful Valley or be executed to preserve the town's secrets.\n\nPhilip is now a prisoner in his new home, with an invisible wall placed to keep him from venturing beyond the yard. He becomes romantically involved with Ellen, and tries to make her realize her own lack of freedom, knowing that the town elders will not let any of Peaceful Valley's residents leave for fear they would reveal the town's secrets. Seemingly persuaded that he cannot reciprocate her love unless she sets him free, Ellen disables the invisible wall and offers to drive Phillip out of town. He arms himself by replicating a revolver and steals a book containing the equations that explain the town's technology, but sets off an alarm in the process. When the three town elders attempt to prevent his escape, he shoots them.\n\nOnce Philip and Ellen are outside the town limits, she shows him that the book is blank, then uses a device to de-materialize him. Ellen was a plant, Philip's entire escape a test. The elders, revived by the technology, claim his decision to create and use a gun confirms their belief that the people of Peaceful Valley are the only ones fit to use the alien technology. Ellen confesses her involvement was not entirely a deception, implying that her feelings for him were real. The elders \"execute\" Philip by rendering him unconscious, erasing his memories of Peaceful Valley, and returning him and his car to the gas station. When he wakes up, the attendant has just finished filling his tank. He asks for directions and drives out of town, experiencing a moment of déjà vu when he sees Ellen, who has tears in her eyes.\n\nYou've seen them. Little towns, tucked away far from the main roads. You've seen them, but have you thought about them? Have you wondered what the people do in such places, why they stay? Philip Redfield thinks about them now and he wonders, but only very late at night, when he's between wakefulness and sleep in the Twilight Zone.\n\nThis is one of many Twilight Zone episodes that re-used props from MGM's 1956 film  Forbidden Planet.

Vollmer demands to know who his mysterious benefactor is. The man steps forward from the shadows to reveal himself to be Adolf Hitler. He orders Vollmer to kill Ernst, and Vollmer steels himself enough to complete the task. Hitler congratulates him and asks how it felt; Vollmer replies that he felt immortal. Hitler responds, \"Mr. Vollmer, we are immortal!\"\n\nPolice officers arrive soon after, to arrest Vollmer for conspiracy to murder Nick. Shot while fleeing, Vollmer is astonished by the sight of his own blood. Hitler's shadow appears on the wall behind Vollmer as he gasps out, \"There's something very wrong here...Don't you understand that I'm made out of steel!?\" As Vollmer dies, alone and forgotten, the Führer slinks away to search for a new mouthpiece.\n\nWhere will he go next, this phantom from another time, this resurrected ghost of a previous nightmare – Chicago? Los Angeles? Miami, Florida? Vincennes, Indiana? Syracuse, New York? Any place, every place where there's hate, where there's prejudice, where there's bigotry – he's alive.

He's alive because through these things we keep him alive.\n\nRod Serling was particularly pleased with the script for \"He's Alive\", and was dismayed when he learned that a scene set between Hitler's revealing himself and Vollmer's returning to Hitler was cut due to length constraints.  This prompted the idea of doing two versions of \"He's Alive\": a short version for television, and a longer version for theatrical release as a feature film.  His extended script added a number of scenes and even a new protagonist, an FBI agent who investigates Vollmer's neo-Nazi movement, but with The Twilight Zone's budget already stretched to the breaking point, Serling's proposal was turned down.

She deduces that Ilse has telepathic abilities by the end of her first day, telling her that her father tried to also raise her to be a telepath and in the end, become a medium. Over time, her teacher is able to teach Ilse to speak instead of using her telepathic abilities.\n\nKarl and Frau Maria Werner, society members from Austria, are alarmed by the lapse in the Nielsens' regular communications and come to check on them. After being informed of the situation, the Werners meet with Ilse and talk to her telepathically. Their telepathic speech is incomprehensible to Ilse, and after continued telepathic prodding she begins sobbing and repeatedly saying, \"My name is Ilse! My name is Ilse!\" The Werners realize that over her weeks in a non-telepathic society, she has lost all knowledge of how to communicate telepathically. They decide to allow the Wheelers to adopt Ilse, even though the Werners are her godparents. Though saddened by Ilse's loss of telepathy, they take comfort in telling themselves that Cora Wheeler loves Ilse more than her parents did. The Werners reveal that Ilse escaped the fire because her parents, though trapped themselves, telepathically guided their daughter from the house.\n\nIt has been noted in a book of proven wisdom that perfect love casteth out fear. While it's unlikely that this observation was meant to include that specific fear which follows the loss of extrasensory perception, the principle remains, as always, beautifully intact.

Mason and Carter go numb with shock. Ross, struggling for an explanation, decides they have bent time in such a way as to get a glimpse of the future. He says to avoid their fate they must refrain from taking off again. Mason and Carter fiercely object to this plan, especially once they find that atmospheric interference prevents their contacting anyone for help, and that the frigid night-time temperatures of the planet will force them to rapidly exhaust the ship's energy reserves on heat. Ross pulls rank to make them comply.\n\nWhile looking out the viewport, Carter is transported back to a country lane on Earth. There, he encounters people from his past. He runs to the house that his wife and he  shared, and finds it empty except for a telegram notifying her that he has died in the line of duty. Carter is wrenched from his vision by Ross; as Carter describes what he has just experienced, he realizes that the people he encountered are dead. Ross insists it was a delusion. The two then find Mason has vanished. He is having an emotional reunion with his wife and child. When Ross pulls him back, Mason is enraged and wants to be allowed back, maintaining that his encounter with his family was real. From Mason's pocket, Ross pulls a newspaper clipping about the death of Mason's wife and child. The captain then posits a new theory about what is going on: The planet is inhabited by telepathic aliens who are using illusions to keep them from reporting back to Earth, thus averting colonization of their home. Ross says that if they take the E-89 back up to space, that should break the spell.\n\nThe men take E-89 back into orbit. Mason and Carter admit that Ross may have been right about the aliens. Ross then insists on landing the craft again to gather foreign samples to bring back to Earth. When they land again, the wreck of their craft is still present. The successive disproving of Ross's theories, combined with an intuitive knowledge of their condition, brings Mason and Carter to the realization that they already crashed and are dead. Their afterlife visits were real, and  their current situation  is the illusion. Ross refuses to accept this. He rejects his crew's pleas to be allowed to embrace their deaths and be reunited with their loved ones, and says that they will \"go over it again and again\" until he figures out an alternative explanation.\n\nThe scene then resets to the moment where Mason first spotted the E-89's wreckage, the crew doomed to repeat the past several hours of investigation forever.\n\nPicture of a man who will not see anything he does not choose to see, including his own death.

Business booms for the little newspaper, as Mr. Smith scoops The Gazette on dramatic news stories, with special editions which sometimes hit the streets barely two hours after the events happen. The owner of The Gazette, Mr. Franklin, offers to buy out The Courier. Though Douglas himself doubts that The Courier can stand up to Franklin's monopolizing tactics, assuming his recent success is down to luck, he refuses his offer. The day after, a fire burns down The Gazette building. When an edition of The Courier goes on sale just two hours after, Franklin accuses Doug of arson. Doug has witnesses to account for his whereabouts at the time, and when he asks Mr. Smith if he caused the fire, Smith successfully dodges the question.\n\nJackie, still suspicious of Mr. Smith, prods Douglas for information on where he came from, and says he should get rid of him now that the $5,000 loan has been repaid. Douglas refuses, and becomes irritable when she asks what he was doing at the bridge where he met Smith.\n\nAt last Mr. Smith reveals why he joined The Courier: he wants Doug to sign a contract assuring Mr. Smith's continued services in exchange for Doug's soul. When Doug is reluctant, Mr. Smith uses a variation of doublethink, arguing that while he believes himself to be the devil, he is clearly mad, and to a sane sophisticated man like Doug things like souls and the devil clearly do not exist. Doug signs the contract.\n\nEventually, however, he comes to the conclusion that Mr. Smith is somehow causing the events that he writes about, and tells Mr. Smith he wants him gone. Smith says that is impossible now that the contract has been signed, and writes a story about Jackie being injured in an auto accident at 11:30—an hour and a half in the future. He tells Douglas that when he joined The Courier he modified the linotype machine so that anything typed on it happens, and will write that Jackie died of her injuries unless Douglas kills himself. In this way Smith could immediately claim his soul and move on to other clients, instead of having to work at The Courier for the rest of Douglas's natural life. Douglas tosses aside the offered gun and goes frantically searching for Jackie. Meanwhile, she confronts Mr. Smith. He agrees to leave town if she gives him a lift, and asks to drive.\n\nUnable to find Jackie, Doug returns to The Courier building and uses the linotype machine to write a new story. The car with Jackie and Mr. Smith runs off the road, but Jackie is uninjured, and Mr. Smith has vanished. Doug shows a confused Jackie the story he wrote, which says that Mr. Smith left town at 11:29, and that his contract with Doug was declared void due to Doug's not fully understanding the terms of the agreement. Douglas resumes running The Courier after having the infernal linotype machine destroyed, and hauled away.\n\nExit the infernal machine, and with it his satanic majesty, Lucifer, prince of darkness—otherwise known as Mr. Smith. He's gone, but not for good; that wouldn't be like him—he's gone for bad. And he might be back, with another ticket....to The Twilight Zone.",

Club gave \"The Parallel\" a rating of C+. He commented that while the episode \"makes a reasonable case for itself in its first half\" with some \"credible worldbuilding\", it suffers from a lack of suspense and any obvious danger to the protagonist. He also described the premise as \"too expected\" and \"too mundane\", adding that the story \"completely falls apart\" in a \"lazily\" written second half which fails to exploit the implications of the ending.[4]\n\nAccording to Jacob Trussell, the episode \"spins its wheels for 20 minutes, dragging out a second-act reveal that the audience has already guessed\".

He uses $1,403 to buy 1,403 acres of land which he knows to contain deposits of oil. He forgets, however, that the drill needed to access oil so far beneath the ground will not be invented until 1937. He tries to \"invent\" devices such as a self-starter for automobiles, but does not know how to design them. The townspeople ridicule this, which causes Feathersmith to suffer palpitations. He realizes that following the strict letter of his terms, Devlin has made him appear 30, but he is still biologically 75. When Devlin appears, Feathersmith accuses her of altering the past, even though she says that all is as it was, and that he just remembered it differently. She needles him for living off the work of others and being unable to create anything himself.\n\nHe pleads with Devlin to send him back to 1963, even after she warns him that his actions in 1910 have changed things, and it can no longer be the 1963 he knew. She agrees to fulfill his wish for just $40. Having no money left, Feathersmith hastily sells the deed to his land to Hecate for the $40.\n\nIn the altered 1963, Hecate is the president of the corporation, having amassed his fortune with the money earned from the oil dug up in 1937, while Feathersmith now works as the building's janitor. Hecate mocks Feathersmith for having been in his position for over forty years.\n\nMr. William J. Feathersmith, tycoon, who tried the track one more time and found it muddier than he remembered, proving with at least a degree of conclusiveness that nice guys don't always finish last, and some people should quit when they're ahead. Tonight's tale of iron men and irony, delivered F.O.B. from the Twilight Zone.\n\nIn the scene in which Feathersmith negotiates his way out of Cliffordville, several crates in the alley are marked \"This End Up\", which were used as shipping crates for the wax figures in the previous episode, \"The New Exhibit\".[citation needed]\n\nIn a published version of Twilight Zone stories, \"Blind Alley\", this story is somewhat different—it takes place during World War II, although Feathersmith is still a self centered sadistic bore—but is also a very sick elderly man . He makes a deal with the Devil to go back in 1910  to his hometown of Cliffordsville, Texas (instead of Indiana). Like in the show, he fails to make any fortune as he realizes too late that the equipment for drilling deep oil hasn't been invented yet. He forgets to ask for the restoration of his health and youth and dies after a  week in the past.[citation needed]",

The original ending was somewhat downbeat, and producer Herbert Hirschman asked Rose to create a slightly different (and happier) ending. Accordingly, the Twilight Zone version of the script is largely identical to the Studio One version, except that an epilogue has been added. In the Studio One version, the story ends at the Fords' apartment, with the audience invited to assume that Horace has been permanently transported back to his miserable past. In the Twilight Zone version, the story continues on: Laura leaves the apartment to find Horace, who magically transforms back into an adult and vows not to live in the past any longer.",

Benteen is unfazed by Sloane's words. He attempts to persuade everyone to stay on V9-Gamma by characterizing Earth as a place of violence and hardship, saying none of them belong there.

They had not expected newcomers since the Lady Anne has had no new passengers in 15 years.

Alan searches the ship with no success, but the other passengers and crew remain nonchalant about the matter. Toby tells Alan that Eileen isn't really gone, but only seems that way because Alan has \"been missing her\". When Alan retires to his room, Eileen is there wearing the nightgown that Millie wore on her honeymoon. She says she has been in the room the whole time, even though Alan had already searched there. Overcome with passion, Alan begins kissing her and symbolically throws his pocket watch overboard through their room's porthole, later explaining that he had become so focused on rushing all the time that he lost sight of what was most important.\n\nThe Ransomes find their love rekindled, and agree with the other passengers that the Lady Anne has a magic that strengthens love. They are in the ship's ballroom when the engines stop. The captain enters and forces the Ransomes off the ship at gunpoint, telling them there isn't time for lengthy explanations. The Ransomes are put into a lifeboat stocked with provisions and set adrift in mid-ocean. Toby assures them that their position has been radioed.

Club, gave it a rating of A−, praising Weston and Williams' acting and humor.[18] David Chase wrote that it was one of his favorite episodes and a portion of the episode was played on TV during a scene of The Sopranos episode Made in America.[19] Marc Scott Zicree, writing in The Twilight Zone Companion, stated that the episode was \"both entertaining and accurate\".[9]\n\nWilliam Bibbiani, writing for /Film in 2023, noted that one of the script ideas proposed by Moomer was similar to Love, American Style.[20] James Maddox wrote in a Game Rant article that Moomer's reliance on existing works and historical figures rather than making original work was a precursor to ChatGPT and other AI-assisted writing tools.[21]",

The two have some fun and redress Max's near-constant absence from his son's life, with Max teaching Pip how to shoot at a shooting gallery. Pip runs off into the house of mirrors, and Max follows. When Max finds him, Pip explains that he is dying and vanishes. Max prays to God and offers to trade his own life in exchange for Pip's. He collapses and dies on the midway.\n\nSome months later, the adult Pip is seen at the park, now walking with the aid of a cane. Max's former landlady Mrs. Feeny is also there with her granddaughter and recalls Max's love for his son. Pip visits the shooting gallery, remembering the wonderful times he had as a child with his father and his father's advice to work the gun and not the jaw. He proclaims that his father was \"[his] best buddy\" as he begins to play the shooting game.\n\nVery little comment here, save for this small aside: that the ties of flesh are deep and strong; that the capacity to love is a vital, rich, and all-consuming function of the human animal. And that you can find nobility and sacrifice and love wherever you may seek it out: down the block, in the heart or - in the Twilight Zone.\n\nJack Klugman appeared in four episodes of the original series.  In addition to this episode, he starred in \"Death Ship\", broadcast seven months earlier, in February, \"A Game of Pool\" (October 1961), and \"A Passage for Trumpet\" (May 1960).  In addition to this episode, Billy Mumy appeared in two other episodes of the original series: 1961's \"It's a Good Life\" (November) and \"Long Distance Call\" (March). He also appeared (credited as Bill Mumy) in the \"It's a Good Life\" segment of Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983),  and the second Twilight Zone revival episode \"It's Still a Good Life\" in 2003.\n\nAmong the six uncredited cast members with speaking roles, three appeared in other episodes. Ross Elliott did receive billing in the earlier Jack Klugman episode \"Death Ship\" although, same as in this episode, he had no scenes with Klugman. Russell Horton was also credited in third season's \"The Changing of the Guard\" (June 1962), playing one of the students. S. John Launer was in three season one episodes, receiving credit in \"The Purple Testament\" (February 1960), but remaining uncredited in \"Third from the Sun\" (January 1960), in which only his voice was heard. His earliest episode, in which he likewise received no credit, was \"And When the Sky Was Opened\" (December 1959).\n\nThe script is essentially a reworked version of the A-plot of “Next of Kin”, a one-hour script Serling wrote for Kraft Television Theatre and which aired on 8 April 1953.  \"In Praise of Pip\" removes two other intertwined stories that were part of \"Next of Kin\", but the first two acts are otherwise almost identical down to the character names, the only change being that Max's son is named Tommy in \"Next Of Kin\", not Pip.  (And the war, of course, is in Korea, not Vietnam.)  Act III, with Max encountering young Pip in the amusement park, is unique to this telling of the story.\n\n\"In Praise of Pip\" opens in Vietnam, with a wounded Pip being brought into a front-line mobile hospital.  Rod Serling originally wanted the episode's opening to take place in Laos; it was CBS who asked for the change to Vietnam.  As a result of the prominent use of Vietnam in the episode, \"In Praise of Pip\" is often incorrectly cited as the first American television drama to mention the growing Vietnam War, or the first to show a Vietnam veteran—both assertions, however, are false.  Starting in March 1963, actor Glenn Corbett had become a regular on the CBS series Route 66, playing returned Vietnam soldier Lincoln Case.  The Vietnam War and its effects on Linc were crucial plot points in several Route 66 episodes, including his debut, which was broadcast six months before this episode.\n\nThis was the first episode sponsored by American Tobacco (on alternate weeks), on behalf of Pall Mall cigarettes, who suggested that Serling and some of the guest stars and supporting players \"light up\" during the episodes. Unlike previous sponsor Liggett & Myers, American Tobacco did not have Serling plug their products at the end of the program.",

He is nearly killed but manages to last the first round. The crowd jeers and boos at \"Maxo's\" performance.\n\nAfterward, the fight promoter pays Kelly only half of the agreed-on $500 fee due to poor performance. Kelly does not protest to prevent recognition. Badly bruised but stubborn as ever, he tells Pole they will use the money to repair Maxo and get him ready to fight again.\n\nPortrait of a losing side, proof positive that you can't outpunch machinery. Proof also of something else: that no matter what the future brings, man's capacity to rise to the occasion will remain unaltered. His potential for tenacity and optimism continues, as always, to outfight, outpoint and outlive any and all changes made by his society, for which three cheers and a unanimous decision rendered from the Twilight Zone.\n\nThis was the first episode sponsored by Procter & Gamble (alternating sponsorship with American Tobacco), who usually \"pitched\" Crest toothpaste, Lilt Home Permanent, and Prell shampoo, among their other products. Serling was not required to endorse any of P&G's products at the end of their episodes.\n\nSerling, in his narration, had predicted that professional boxing would be outlawed within five years of the episode's airing; at the time, the sport was mired in controversy after Emile Griffith killed his opponent Benny Paret in a nationally televised and particularly brutal 1962 match. With Paret's death at Griffith's hands, as well as the death of Davey Moore from a neck injury sustained in a March 1963 contest,[1] the specter of the sport being outlawed was a realistic possibility at the time \"Steel\" was broadcast.[2] Serling's prediction did not come to fruition; although boxing declined in popularity in the succeeding years, it has never been outlawed.\n\nEach of the five credited cast members appeared in one other episode — Lee Marvin starred in \"The Grave\" (October 1961), Joe Mantell starred as \"Nervous Man in a Four Dollar Room\" (October 1960), Chuck Hicks had an uncredited bit part as a mover in \"Ninety Years Without Slumbering\" (December 1963, two months after this episode), Merritt Bohn was billed at the bottom of the cast list in a bit part as a truck driver in Twilight Zone's second episode, \"One for the Angels\" (October 1959) and Frank London was billed third from the end in a bit part as a driver in \"\"A Penny for Your Thoughts\" (February 1961).",

          "plot": "In response to his repeated attempts to raise an alarm, the flight engineer comes out to evaluate the situation and the stewardess gives Robert a sedative, which he pretends to take but spits out. Robert then takes a sleeping police officer's revolver, straps himself in, and opens an emergency exit window by which he is sitting. Fighting against the wind and rain, he shoots repeatedly at the gremlin, who is struck and falls off the wing.\n\nOnce the airplane has landed, Robert is whisked away on a gurney and in a straitjacket. He tells his wife that only he really knows what happened during the flight. In the final scene, the camera cranes up and tracks back to reveal damage to one of the aircraft's engines, as yet unnoticed by anyone.\n\nThe flight of Mr. Robert Wilson has ended now, a flight not only from point A to point B, but also from the fear of recurring mental breakdown. Mr. Wilson has that fear no longer... though, for the moment, he is, as he has said, alone in this assurance. Happily, his conviction will not remain isolated too much longer, for happily, tangible manifestation is very often left as evidence of trespass, even from so intangible a quarter as the Twilight Zone.\n\nWilliam Shatner and Christine White each appeared in one earlier episode of the original series. Shatner starred in \"Nick of Time\" (October 1960) and White had the female lead in \"The Prime Mover\" (March 1961).\n\nThe short story which appeared in 1961 in Alone by Night differs from the TV episode.[2] In the short story, the name is Arthur Jeffrey Wilson, while in the TV episode it is Robert or Bob Wilson. The major difference is that Wilson is flying alone in the story. His wife's name is given as Jacqueline, while in the episode it is Julia. Wilson has two sons in the story. In the story, the gun is brought aboard the airplane by Wilson undetected. He experiences nausea when he flies and takes Dramamine pills. This explains his anxiety.\n\nIn the episode, Wilson's earlier hospitalization is detailed as the background to his anxiety. He has had a nervous breakdown and is in recovery. In the short story, by contrast, this background is absent. Instead, Wilson is suicidal. At one point, he takes out his gun and contemplates shooting himself.\n\nHe describes the apparition as a \"gremlin\" and explains that Allied pilots had seen unidentified objects during World War II. This detail is briefly mentioned by Wilson in the episode.\n\nThe story and the episode are both ambiguous about the creature. In the story, it is described as a \"filthy little animal\" but also as a \"man\" like in the episode. The creature has \"a face not human\" in the story.\n\nIn the story, Wilson stated that it would be revealed that what he said was true when the airplane was inspected. In the episode, the damaged engine is shown that vindicates Wilson's account. Nevertheless, both endings are ambiguous. In the story, we have to rely on Wilson's own account of events. In the episode, the damaged engine suggests his version may be true, but there is no evidence that it was due to the gremlin.\n\nThe episode was remade in 1983 by director George Miller as a segment of Twilight Zone: The Movie.[3][4] John Valentine, played by John Lithgow, suffers from severe fear of flying. The plane flies through a violent thunderstorm, and Valentine hides in the lavatory trying to recover from a panic attack, but the flight attendants coax him back to his seat. He notices a hideous gremlin on the wing of the plane and begins to spiral into another severe panic. He watches as the creature wreaks havoc on the wing, damaging the plane's engine. Valentine finally snaps and attempts to break the window with an oxygen canister, but is wrestled to the ground by another passenger (an off-duty security guard). Valentine takes the passenger's gun, shoots out the window (causing a breach in the pressurized cabin), and begins firing at the gremlin. This catches the attention of the gremlin, who rushes up to Valentine and destroys the gun, then leaps away into the sky. The police, crew, and passengers write off Valentine as insane. However, while a straitjacketed Valentine is carried off in an ambulance claiming that he is a hero, the aircraft maintenance crew arrives and finds the damage to the plane's engines, complete with claw marks which alerts everyone.",

Erich begins to question whether the doll talking to him is just his imagination, and he offers to return it to Christie if Annabelle will stay. He takes the doll out of the trash and returns it to Christie.\n\nLater that night, Erich is awakened by the sound of muffled whirring. He tells Annabelle to stay in the bedroom and leaves to investigate. Christie is in bed, but Tina is gone. Going down the stairs, he trips over Tina, who is lying on one of the treads, and falls, sustaining fatal injuries. Attracted by the noise, Annabelle finds Erich. Beside him is Tina, who opens her eyes and threatens Annabelle by saying, \"My name is Talky Tina... and you'd better be nice to me!\" Realizing that Erich was telling the truth, Annabelle drops the doll in shock.\n\nOf course, we all know dolls can't really talk, and they certainly can't commit murder.

French tempts the townspeople with some of the food Goldsmith claimed was contaminated and many throw caution to the wind and partake. Everyone except Goldsmith eventually consumes the food and drink and Goldsmith falls into disfavor among the townspeople. After being bullied and threatened with his life, Goldsmith finally opens the cave door and it is ultimately revealed that in reality, the townsfolk have been using information from a computer the whole time. French rallies the townspeople into a frothing frenzy into destroying the machine, after which French leads the people into celebrating their newfound freedom from this \"tyranny.\" However, as Goldsmith had insisted, the \"old man\" was correct; without an authority figure to tell them which foods are safe, the entire human population of the town (including French and the soldiers) die—except for the lone survivor, Goldsmith, who somberly walks out of the now dead town.\n\nMr. Goldsmith, survivor.

The other cast member who appeared in more than one episode was John Marley who played the superintendent of the old-age home in \"Kick the Can\" (February 1962).\n\nIn the post-apocalyptic world presented in the episode, humanity has destroyed itself, but does so through \"greed, desire and faithlessness\".[1] It is thus a warning not to ignore faith, which often serves an important purpose in society. The events in the episode show that myths and beliefs are often based on fact or necessity, as is the case with the \"old man\" who, despite being a computer, was ultimately keeping his \"followers\" alive. According to Valerie Barr of Hofstra University, it also \"turns the usual notion of overreliance on technology on its head\" by suggesting an interdependence with machines when it is revealed that a man-made computer has been keeping the townspeople alive.[2] A suggested learning plan accompanying this episode for the SyFy Channel's participation in Cable in the Classroom provides a platform for exploring ideas about war, faith, and the question of whether humans control computers or vice versa.[3]\n\nFilm critic Andrew Sarris noted in his review of \"Time Enough at Last\" that, at the time The Twilight Zone was produced, depicting an atom bomb explosion or its aftermath on network television would likely have been prohibited if it had been \"couched in a more realistic format\".[4] Hence, in both this episode and \"The Shelter\", Serling makes a point of noting that the story is intended to be fictional, particularly given both are set in the United States.",

Adam and Eve begin a new life on this planet she calls \"Earth\".

Hours before \"Night Call\" was to air though, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas.  Thus it was rescheduled, as were all of the other network shows.  As a result, \"Probe 7, Over and Out\" immediately follows \"Uncle Simon\" in original broadcast order. \"Night Call\" was eventually broadcast on February 7, 1964.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Twilight Zone historian Marc Scott Zicree recorded a commentary track with director Ted Post discussing this episode.

Most notably, in Tick of Time the main character did indeed die when the clock stopped. Johnson disapproved of the changes made to his story, especially Sam Forstmann's anticlimactic confrontation with his own ghost: \"It makes the whole plot trivial. In order to get involved with Sam Forstmann's issues, you've got to believe in those issues. So if Sam himself suddenly stops believing in them, it's a cheat.\"[1] Accordingly, Johnson was credited onscreen under a pseudonym.\n\nMarc Scott Zicree, author of The Twilight Zone Companion, was similarly appalled by the \"inept\" rewriting of Tick of Time as 90 Years Without Slumbering, particularly the climax: \"Imagine: Sam Forstmann has fanatically clung to his beliefs, however misguided, in the face of all logic to the contrary; he has proclaimed said beliefs to a psychiatrist, even resorted to breaking and entering to keep the clock ticking...and what does he do at the last possible moment?

The doctor gives Bunny's prescription slip to Hildy, but Bunny insists on accompanying Bud to the drugstore. On the way, they stop by her old school to meet Gentry, whom she asks to leave the school gates open. She then goes to the local TV station for an impromptu interview with Braden. In the interview, she announces a one-woman show in the high school gymnasium for the same time as the picnic. When Braden points out the conflict, she flippantly says the people will enjoy her show more.\n\nHildy accuses Bunny of \"showing off\" by forcing the town to choose between seeing her or attending the picnic. Bunny insists that she loves the town and its people and that she is using her show as a way of thanking them. Hildy at first intends to go to the picnic with Bud. When Bunny sees a vision in her ring of a jetliner and its passengers, including herself and her manager, Hildy reconsiders and agrees to attend Bunny's show. As they are about to leave, it begins to rain. As they hear sirens outside, Bunny envisions herself on the jetliner in the rain, and she hugs her slightly bewildered sister. A breaking news flash comes on over the radio, and while Hildy and Bud are listening to the first reports of an airplane crash, Bunny quietly says goodbye, goes outside in the rain and vanishes.\n\nA police officer calls to inform Hildy that Bunny was killed in the plane crash. The radio news anchor notes conflicting reports from onlookers who said that Bunny was on the plane and several townspeople who had seen her in town that day. The anchorman notes that many of the townspeople were in the auditorium waiting to see Bunny's show and that they would have died had they gone to the picnic because the jetliner crashed on the grounds. Hildy finds Bunny's ring, which had fallen to the floor and is now chipped and charred, and she realizes that Bunny had predicted her impending death in the plane crash and had come in spirit via the ring to save her friends and family.\n\nWe are all travelers.

          "plot": "Oliver Pope, businessman-turned-killer, on a rain-soaked street in the early evening of just another day during just another drive home from the office. The victim, a kid on a bicycle, lying injured, near death. But Mr. Pope hasn't time for the victim, his only concern is for himself. Oliver Pope, hit-and-run driver, just arrived at a crossroad in his life, and he's chosen the wrong turn. The hit occurred in the world he knows, but the run will lead him straight into - the Twilight Zone.\n\nOliver \"Ollie\" Pope is a nervous and distracted office manager. While driving home, he slams his 1956 Ford Fairlane Club Sedan into Timmy Danvers, a boy delivering newspapers on his bicycle, mortally injuring him. Pope stops to offer aid, but changes his mind and hurries off to conceal his part in the accident but not before Muriel Hastings, a witness nearby, tries to stop him. Timmy later dies of his injuries. Pope's wife Lillian and his co-workers notice that he is becoming increasingly irritable. A co-worker named Pete Radcliff is mistakenly identified as the perpetrator by Hastings while the authorities stake out the scene of the crime. Pope does nothing to correct the error, having previously told his wife of his suspicion that Radcliff was trying to steal his job.\n\nBefore long, Pope's Fairlane seems to take on a mind of its own, rebelling against its owner. At first, when he is near the car, it honks its horn, flashes its lights, attempts to start on its own, drops its bumper, tries to close its hood on him, and repeats the radio newsflash of the boy's death in an attempt to get his attention. Then, while his wife is driving the Fairlane, it drives to the scene of the accident and stalls out, seemingly determined to get Pope to admit his guilt. He makes excuses to his wife and continues trying to cover up his crime.\n\nPope starts walking to work in an effort to avoid his car to lower the risk of being exposed to the authorities. One day, as he heads out into the rain, the Fairlane leaves the garage on its own and chases him relentlessly down the street. Pope falls, but the car stops just before running him down. The passenger door opens and Pope gets in. The Fairlane drives him to a police station, where Pope gets out and walks in to confess.\n\nAll persons attempting to conceal criminal acts involving their cars are hereby warned: check first to see that underneath that chrome there does not lie a conscience, especially if you're driving along a rain-soaked highway in the Twilight Zone.\n\nExternal shots (involving the car) of Pope's home and the park were filmed in a neighborhood in Culver City, California. The house that served as Pope's home still stands at 4183 Keystone Avenue (the address appears on an exterior shot in the episode) and the nearby park where the accident took place is the Dr. Paul Carlson Memorial Park. It is located a few blocks from the Sony Pictures (formerly MGM) lot. The scenes where Pope is chased by his car were filmed on Jasmine Avenue. The home at 4262 (as shown in the episode) has since been replaced. However, the adjoining yard that he runs through (and house) are still there and readily identifiable. Other homes seen in this episode are: 4182 Le Bourget Drive opposite Carlson Park, 4183 Jasmine Avenue and 10339 Braddock Drive.[1]\n\nThere is also a scene where the car is driving down a tree lined street and various industrial looking buildings appear in the background. The street is Mentone Avenue and the buildings in the background are on the main lot of MGM studios. The largest building is the MGM Scenic background department building.[2]",

This is the beginning, the first step towards man's longest leap into the unknown. Science has solved the mechanical details and now it's up to one human being to breathe life into blueprints and computers, to prove once and for all that man can live half a lifetime in the total void of outer space, forty years alone in the unknown.

The vast region in between is the Twilight Zone.\n\nCommander Douglas Stansfield, age 31, an astronaut in the year 1987, is scheduled in six months to be sent on an exploratory mission to a planetary system roughly 141 light-years from Earth. Although the spacecraft will travel at the rate of 7 times the speed of light, the round trip will still take forty years. To save him the ordeal of 40 years of loneliness, he is to be placed in (newly developed) suspended animation for the twenty-year trip to his goal, and again for the twenty-year return trip.  During his time in suspended animation, he will age only a few weeks.\n\nShortly before his mission, he meets and is enchanted by his young colleague, Sandra Horn. They meet that night, after only three and half hours, they declare their love for each other, and lament the fact that when Stansfield returns, Sandra will be an old woman.\n\nForty years later, Stansfield returns to Earth, a forgotten pioneer. The discoveries he made on his mission were independently achieved earlier by technology developed after his departure. Sandra is waiting for him, still 26 and lovely. She had herself put in suspended animation during Stansfield's mission. Stansfield, however, had voluntarily disabled his suspended-animation system six months into his journey after a communications failure on his ship, and is now a man of 70. He has endured forty years of inconceivable loneliness in the hope of being with Sandra when he returned. Sandra offers to continue their relationship, but the heartbroken Stansfield urges Sandra to begin a new life without him.\n\nAfter Sandra leaves, General Walters offers some small consolation to the aged astronaut: \"Stansfield, you're really quite an incredible man. It may be the one distinction of my entire life, that I knew you ... that I knew a man who put such a premium on love.  Truly, truly quite a distinction, Stansfield.\"\n\nCommander Douglas Stansfield, one of the forgotten pioneers of the space age.

Her mother takes her to see Dr. Rex, who initially thinks Marilyn wants to have the procedure early, but is shocked to learn about Marilyn's refusal.\n\nDr. Rex sends her to Professor Sigmund Friend, who claims that the Transformation is justified as it has led to the end of war and hate in society, along with many health benefits, in addition to the change in appearance.  When Marilyn protests that she still does not want the procedure, he has Marilyn confined to a hospital room against her will, ostensibly to psychologically examine her and cure her of her reason for refusing the procedure. Marilyn suspects that despite not being legally required, the Transformation is not optional, and is being maintained by the leaders of society to ensure conformity. Her best friend Valerie, who has already undergone the Transformation, shows no emotional reaction to Marilyn's protests, even when she is driven to tears. Marilyn realizes that no one who has undergone the Transformation remains capable of any empathy for or understanding of her. She tries to escape from the hospital, but ends up in the operating room to undergo the Transformation.\n\nDr. Rex, who operated on Marilyn, comments that some people have problems with the idea of the Transformation but that \"improvements\" to the procedure now guarantee a positive result. Marilyn reappears, looking and thinking exactly like Valerie. \"And the nicest part of all, Val\", she gushes, \"I look just like you!\"\n\nPortrait of a young lady in love—with herself. Improbable?

          "plot": "Now that she can talk to him again, she realizes she won't have to be alone. At home, she picks up the phone and calls to Brian's ghost, pleading with him to answer. He replies that she told him to leave her alone and that he always does what she says. Then the line goes dead, leaving Elva alone and crying in her bed.\n\nAccording to the Bible, God created the Heavens and the Earth. It is man's prerogative—and woman's—to create their own particular and private Hell. Case in point, Miss Elva Keene, who in every sense has made her own bed and now must lie in it, sadder, but wiser, by dint of a rather painful lesson in responsibility, transmitted from the Twilight Zone.\n\nThe caller is never identified in the original short story. The night after she finds out the voice is coming from the cemetery, she receives a call in which the voice says: \"Hello, Mrs. Keene. I'll be right over.\" The short story creates a heightened level of horror because the unknown speaker on the phone gradually improves in cognition and speech to the point where they seek to interact with her physically, conjuring up images of the walking dead and reanimated corpses.\n\nThe original anthologized short story title, \"Long Distance Call\", was changed to \"Night Call\" because there had already been an episode of The Twilight Zone in 1961 with that title.\n\nThe premiere of \"Night Call\" was scheduled for Friday, November 22, 1963.[1] Hours before it was to air, however, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. It was rescheduled, as were all of the other network shows. \"Night Call\" finally premiered on February 7, 1964.",

She tells her mother her recollection of what happened up on the ridge, pointing out that there is a saying, \"Go chase yourself,\" and she realizes she has been doing just that. Her mother, having received another phone call from an otherwise unidentified lawyer, is devastated about losing the estate in a pending dispossession and seems uninterested in her daughter's metaphysical time-traveling marvel. Anne disparages her now deceased father for spoiling her and not allowing her to earn anything or learn such things as judgment and discrimination. Her mother slaps her for \"debasing\" her father's memory, and Anne slaps her back, declaring her mother's comments to be \"cornball\". Anne asks her mother if she remembers that night, 25 years earlier, when she came home terrified after riding her horse. Anne now realizes she was pursuing her younger self on horseback, trying to warn herself not to marry the wrong man. She notes that her dissolute and abusive husband has bankrupted the estate through mismanagement. However, her husband is not Robert but the arrogant, pushy, mercurial David, with whom Anne eloped from her engagement party 25 years ago.\n\nThe older Anne leaves the house for another ride on horseback. She again approaches the ridge line and sees her younger self down below. She pursues the young Anne with her warning, and her words are now audible: \"Anne...wait...come back!\" but the younger Anne still cannot hear her, and the older Anne is still unable to catch her.\n\nThis is the face of terror. Anne Marie Mitchell, 43 years of age, her desolate existence once more afflicted by the hope of altering her past mistake - a hope which is unfortunately doomed to disappointment. For warnings from the future to the past must be taken in the past. Today may change tomorrow, but once today is gone, tomorrow can only look back in sorrow that the warning was ignored.

The town clergyman, although a different faith and race than Jagger, steps in and says that he is thankful to him for having stood up for him and his kind.  The clergyman asks if Jagger had felt hate and enjoyment when he killed the man. Jagger confirms he did. After this, the clergyman also reluctantly agrees to the execution, proclaiming that Jagger was in fact guilty.  Jagger is disheartened, saying “It’s important to get with the majority isn’t it? That’s a big thing nowadays isn’t it, Reverend?” The Reverend replies: \"That’s all there is, is the majority. The minority must have died on the cross 2,000 years ago\". After the hanging, the deputy says that for having gone along with the execution, that the clergyman has \"seen the light\". The clergyman replies that the sky is black because of all the hatred in the world, namely the hatred surrounding Jagger's execution.  The sky becomes even darker after the execution.  The deputy is convinced that the darkness is nothing more than fog, which will eventually lift, but neither the sheriff nor the reporter is convinced.\n\nLater, a radio broadcast reveals that the town is not the only place where this disturbance is happening. The sky has turned dark over North Vietnam; a section of the Berlin Wall; areas of Shanghai and Birmingham, AL; a political prison in Budapest; a section of Dallas (where President Kennedy was fatally shot), and other places around the world where hatred runs rampant.\n\nA sickness known as hate. Not a virus, not a microbe, not a germ—but a sickness nonetheless, highly contagious, deadly in its effects. Don't look for it in the Twilight Zone—look for it in a mirror. Look for it before the light goes out altogether.\n\nSerling wrote this script primarily as his personal reaction to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963. Indeed, mention is made in the story of \"a street in Dallas, Texas\" (where Kennedy was murdered as his motorcade traveled down Elm Street in Dallas' Dealey Plaza) as being enveloped by the strange darkness.\n\nThe episode is similar to \"Many, Many Monkeys\", a script written for Twilight Zone by its producer, William Froug, but never shot. In that script an epidemic breaks out in which afflicted persons' eyes seal shut as folds of flesh grow over them. Though a nuclear explosion is initially blamed, one character proposes that it is a physical manifestation of hate that is blinding them. The network bought the script but then shelved it, finding its subject matter too disturbing, but it was eventually produced in 1989, during the first revival of Twilight Zone.\n\nYears earlier, Serling had written a teleplay for Playhouse 90 called \"A Town Has Turned to Dust\", about the 1870 lynching of an innocent Mexican man in a Southwestern town. This story was based on the Emmett Till case, and Serling had to deal with executive interference and network censors before the episode could air.[1]",

Little do they realize that all Mr. Flemington is suffering from is a case of poetic justice. Tonight's tale of sounds and silences from the Twilight Zone.\n\nIn 1961, a script titled \"The Sound of Silence\" was submitted to the producers and rejected. Following the first screening of \"Sounds and Silences\", the original author successfully sued Rod Serling for plagiarism because of similarities in the plot, and was awarded $3,500 in damages.

The duo sneaks into the nightclub to break into the manager's office. However, they are caught by a night watchman after they steal money from the nightclub's safe. They manage to bluff their way past him by giving an impromptu routine.\n\nWhen Jonathan and Caesar arrive home, Susan eavesdrops on their ensuing argument. The next morning over breakfast, Susan hears her aunt, Mrs. Cudahy, read about the nightclub theft from a newspaper. She calls the police to tip them off about Jonathan and Caesar. Two detectives arrive at the boarding house and interrogate Jonathan, who tries to make Caesar talk about his role in the crime. The dummy, however, remains silent. Mrs. Cudahy and the detectives stare at the one-sided exchange, thinking Jonathan mad. Jonathan now realizes that Caesar has abandoned him and is willingly arrested.\n\nAfter the detectives lead Jonathan out of the room, Caesar turns his head around and addresses Susan, who lingered and is the last to leave. She triumphantly tells him she knew all the time he could speak. He says he likes her for her \"hip attitude\" and offers to help her run away to New York City. Caesar assures Susan that Jonathan will now be gone \"a long, long time\" and that the two of them are now \"a team\". Finally, Caesar hints Susan should kill her aunt with poison darts. She says nothing and smiles.\n\nA little girl and a wooden doll. A lethal dummy in the shape of a man. But everybody knows dummies can't talk—unless, of course, they learn their vocabulary in the Twilight Zone.\n\nThe writer of the episode, Adele Strassfield, was the secretary of William Froug, the producer of the second half of the final season of The Twilight Zone.  According to Froug, they worked out this episode together.  Strassfield is billed in the credits as \"Adele T. Strassfield\", not \"A.T. Strassfield\" as Zicree inexplicably avers in The Twilight Zone Companion; Serling also announced her as \"Adele T. Strassfield\" in a promotional announcement for the episode that aired the previous week. Strassfield is the only woman credited with writing an original teleplay for the original version of The Twilight Zone, though several women received credit for stories that were adapted for the show. She later wrote a first-season episode of Gilligan's Island with executive producer Froug's assistance.\n\nThe dummy used in this episode to portray \"Caesar\" was originally created in the 1940s by puppet maker Revello Petee. The same dummy was used one year earlier in the 1962 Twilight Zone episode, \"The Dummy\". A figure of the puppet can be seen at Disney's Hollywood Studios in the dark corner of a barred-off exhibit to the side of one of the elevator exits of the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror ride.",

          "plot": "In response to an insult from Fenton, Takamori describes his experience as a small child at Pearl Harbor. His father was a construction foreman who helped build the harbor. Takamori watched as the planes bombed the harbor, and his father with it. He first states his father tried to alert sailors to the attack, but then confesses that his father was actually a traitor who directed where the planes should drop the bombs.[1][2][3] Seeing Takamori's guilt, Fenton tries to offer some comfort. The sword, however, appears to be dictating the course of the conversation, and soon Takamori accuses Fenton of being a murderer because he killed an unarmed man. Fenton defends himself by saying his orders were to take no prisoners.\n\nIn a sudden depression, Fenton admits that he is unhappy with himself and what he has done. He has lost his job, his wife is leaving him, he is consumed with hostility and bigotry, and he coaxed Takamori into conversation because he does not want to be left alone.[3] But Takamori, now thoroughly under the controlling influence of the sword, poises to kill Fenton. Fenton seizes him by his sword arm and overpowers him, and the samurai sword is dropped, wedging into the table supports, pointing upward. Going down to the floor to retrieve it, Fenton is then fatally impaled on the sword when Takamori pulls at his feet. Takamori takes the sword, shrieks \"Banzai!\" and jumps out the attic window, presumably to his death.[3]\n\nTwo men in an attic, locked in mortal embrace. Their common bond, and their common enemy: guilt. A disease all too prevalent amongst men both in and out of The Twilight Zone.",

          "plot": "Later that night, Garrity and his assistant Ace (who was both wagon driver and \"resurrectee\") ride away with the money, joking about how they cannot actually bring the dead back to life: they had simply performed a few smoke and mirrors tricks to con the townsfolk and used a dog that was alive the whole time, but simply knew how to play dead.\n\nAfter they have left the town, the last scene reveals that the dead really are rising from the grave, with one commenting that the peddler underestimates his own ability. One revived person is looking forward to getting back into town to get caught up on his drinking. A revived criminal has unfinished business with the sheriff. A woman named Zelda Gooberman plans to break her husband's arm for what she sees in him. As Garrity continues to ride away from Happiness, Arizona, the final shot shows the deserted Boot Hill cemetery.\n\nExit Mr. Garrity, a would-be charlatan, a make-believe con man and a sad misjudger of his own talents. Respectfully submitted from an empty cemetery on a dark hillside that is one of the slopes leading to the Twilight Zone.\n\nThe story was based on an 1873 incident in Alta, Utah, in which a stranger arrived in the mining town and offered to raise the dead. Initially optimistic, residents reconsidered after reflecting on the potential complications to those who had inherited property, and those who had remarried after their spouses died. They collected $2,500 (equivalent to $65,618 in 2024) to persuade the stranger to leave town without following through on his offer.[2] Sportswriter Mike Korologos read about the incident in the American Guide Series, and wrote about it for a 1963 article in The Salt Lake Tribune. The Alta Ski Area reprinted his article the following winter in their newsletter, where Serling read it while visiting the resort.[3]",

Whipple joins Hanley at the bar opposite his factory and expresses deep sorrow at his misfortune as he rambles about how it is not fair that machines are replacing men, his poetic justice for caring more about machines in the first place. He also admits that he is lonely because he is not married and has no family and that he feels cast aside like a used part.\n\nThe last scene reveals Whipple's replacement to be a robot (Robby the Robot), which swings Whipple's key on a chain the same way he used to.\n\nThere are many bromides applicable here: 'too much of a good thing', 'tiger by the tail', 'as you sow so shall you reap'. The point is that, too often, Man becomes clever instead of becoming wise; he becomes inventive and not thoughtful; and sometimes, as in the case of Mr. Whipple, he can create himself right out of existence. As in tonight's tale of oddness and obsolescence, in the Twilight Zone.\n\nThe robot that ultimately replaces Mr. Whipple is \"Robby the Robot\" from the 1956 Sci-Fi film Forbidden Planet. \"Robby\" appeared in two other episodes of The Twilight Zone: \"One for the Angels\", the second episode of the series (as a miniature toy), and \"Uncle Simon.\"",

          "plot": "Sometime later, a young man named Billy Rayford shows up with a rifle. \"The Rayford brothers\" have been mentioned in the song and Mary Rachel has said that she is \"bespoke\" unto Billy Rayford. Billy accuses Floyd of seducing his intended bride and tries to take Floyd back to his brothers, but Floyd resists. He accidentally kills Rayford and starts the tape recorder playing. The recording has a new verse that Mary Rachel hadn't previously sung. The new verse reflects the event that just happened (\"You killed Billy Rayford/ 'neath an old willow tree...\"), and foreshadows a future attack. Floyd runs off, dragging Mary Rachel with him while she tries to convince him to stay.\n\nMary Rachel sings a new verse of the song where Billy Rayford's three brothers find Billy's body, mourn his death near the lake, and vow to avenge Billy. As Floyd prepares to flee, Mary Rachel begs him to stay, hoping things will be different \"this time\". She implies that these same events have occurred many times before, but when he suggests that she has been with different men, she says it is always Floyd. As Floyd runs away, he looks back and sees that Mary Rachel is now dressed in black, with a black shawl, mourning, and professing her love for Floyd.\n\nFloyd makes it back to the shop in the woods where the old man declines to help him hide. Floyd clubs the old man over the head, then hides among the musical instruments. When he bumps a music box, it starts playing, and soon all the instruments in the shop are chiming, ringing, or clanging. The three Rayford brothers arrive, see the old man's body, and close in on Floyd. As Floyd is shot, the camera returns to the tombstone in the first scene, thus fulfilling the prophecy within the song that Floyd would die.\n\nIn retrospect, it may be said of Mr. Floyd Burney that he achieved that final dream of the performer: eternal top-name billing, not on the fleeting billboards of the entertainment world, but forever recorded among the folk songs of the Twilight Zone.\n\nAccording to The Twilight Zone Companion, Liza Minnelli auditioned for the role of Mary Rachel, but was so nervous during the audition she was rejected.  Although this was the third-to-last episode broadcast, this was the last episode in the series to be filmed.  (The last original episode to be broadcast was \"The Bewitchin' Pool\".  The last episode to be broadcast during the original run—as a repeat—was \"The Jeopardy Room\".)\n\nIn an interview, episode director Richard Donner stated he thought Bonnie Beecher \"was going to become a very important actress\" and asserted that he (not fifth season producer William Froug) selected Beecher over Minnelli for the role because he thought she was \"incredible.\"[1]\n\nAccording to The Twilight Zone: The 50th Anniversary Tribute, by Carol Serling and Douglas Brode, in this episode which aired May 22, 1964, \"Gary Crosby played the first Bob Dylan-style 'folkie' to appear on the small screen.\"[2]",

Introduction to a father: Gil Sharewood, handsome, prosperous, the picture of success. A man who has achieved every man's ambition. Beautiful children, beautiful home, beautiful wife. Idyllic? Obviously. But don't look too carefully, don't peek behind the façade. The idyll may have feet of clay.\n\nSport Sharewood and her younger brother Jeb live in a large, expensive house, but their parents are cold, ill-tempered, self-centered, and constantly bickering with each other.\n\nWhile Sport and Jeb are sitting beside their swimming pool, Whitt, a young boy in a straw hat, pops up from the deep end of the pool and invites them to follow him. The children dive underwater only to come back up in a swimming hole bordering a rustic, simple homestead, with an assortment of children playing in the yard. In contrast to their lavish home of neglect and insults, they are welcomed and loved from the moment they arrive at this humble children's paradise. There is only one adult there, \"Aunt T\", a kind and patient elderly woman who loves children. She explains that she has many children there who came from parents who did not deserve them.\n\nSport and Jeb go home, for fear that their parents will be worried. \"Aunt T\" advises them that they likely will not be able to return as few children can find their way back. But Jeb later returns to Aunt T's, and Sport is sent by her mother to go and find him because she has something to tell them about some decisions that are made that will make all their lives better.  Sport finds Jeb at Aunt T's but he refuses to go back. Sport convinces him by telling him that their mother has promised everything will be better; he reluctantly agrees to return with her.  Back home, their parents inform them they are planning to divorce and they must decide which parent they will live with. The children refuse and run back outside and dive back into the pool; when they do not reemerge, their father jumps in to rescue them, but discovers they have disappeared.\n\nSport and Jeb are able to escape and are now happily living with Aunt T. Sport hears the distant voice of her mother but ignores it and focuses on her new life.\n\nA brief epilogue for concerned parents. Of course, there isn't any such place as the gingerbread house of Aunt T, and we grownups know there's no door at the bottom of a swimming pool that leads to a secret place. But who can say how real the fantasy world of lonely children can become? For Jeb and Sport Sharewood, the need for love turned fantasy into reality; they found a secret place—in the Twilight Zone.\n\nThis was the final original episode of the original Twilight Zone series to be broadcast, though not the last to be filmed.
